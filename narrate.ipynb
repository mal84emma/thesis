There are lots of ways of slicing up the carbon pie.', 'But from a scientific perspective, there are three broad areas to decarbonise: industrial processes, where chemists must figure out how to make the materials we need without producing CO2 along the way; agriculture, where biologists need to find ways to grow enough food without releasing CO2 and methane; and energy, where physicists and engineers have to produce the electricity and heat that support modern life without using fossil fuels.', 'This all needs to be done at a cost that is low enough that society is willing to make the transition, and without ever interrupting supply. Imagine rebuilding your tennis racket out of new materials while making sure you stay in the rally.', 'Within energy, many sectors such as heating and transportation plan to decarbonise by electrification (potentially using hydrogen to store and transport the energy). A key example of this is the shift towards using heat pumps for space heating. As a result, electricity demand is expected to increase by a factor 3 or 4 by 2050. Decarbonising this electricity will require vast amounts of renewable power generation to be integrated into the grid. It’s estimated that around 100 GW of wind and 60 GW of solar generation will need to be constructed in the UK by 2050. To support the new generation mix with mostly renewables, the grid will need to be redesigned to manage the variability of these new energy sources, and make sure electricity is available when it’s needed. Adapting the electricity system to overcome this challenge of security of supply will be costly, on top of the already hefty cost of building the renewables. It will require building new supporting infrastructure, primarily transmission lines and bulk energy storage, at scales rivaling the original construction of the power grids, and new methods for operating the grid to balance the system far more quickly and plan over horizons of months rather than days.']\n"
