    There's only one name on the front of a thesis. But it takes a village to write one.

    I've had the privilege of getting to know so many amazing people during my time at Cambridge. I really believe that they're the best thing about this university. Though the swoosh of a gown as you stride across a college courtyard does run a close second.
    Without their support, encouragement, and advice, I wouldn't have even attempted a PhD, let alone finished one.

    And so I will attempt, and fail, to communicate the depth of my gratitude to all those who have helped me on this journey.\\

    First and foremost, I owe so much of my progress over this PhD, both in research and beyond, to the patience and guidance of my supervisor, Ruchi.
    Thank you for so expertly finding that delicate balance of supporting me to do my best, and encouraging me to do even better. I couldn't have hoped for a better supervisor.

    One of Ruchi's many talents is that she gathers wonderful people around her. I've learnt much from the EECi team, and had lots of fun doing it, including a truly delightful month in Stanford. I've also had the chance to work with other fantastic researchers outside of EECi: Zoltan Nagy, Kingsley Nweye, Wonjun Choi, Jie Lu, and Fabian Raisch. Collaborating with them has been rewarding, interesting, and has prompted me to consider if the Cambridge way of doing things is in fact the only way.

    I wouldn't have even considered doing a PhD without the support and encouragement of John Miles. Thank you for being so generous with your time and advice, and giving me the opportunity to discover for myself the joy of research.
    I'm also very grateful to Domenic Di Francesco for patiently guiding me through my initial stumblings with the Value of Information, and persevering with me as I figured out how to say what I actually mean.
    My journey into energy research began with David MacKay's quintessential book, Sustainable Energy -- Without the Hot Air. It continues to inspire me to look at energy more clearly, and communicate more succinctly.

    Through my time at Emmanuel College, Alexandre Kabla has been an incredible mentor and supporter, always finding the time to help me no matter how busy term got.

    And I would like to give a special thanks to the ever amazing Emmanuel Engineers. They have been an absolute joy to teach, always managing to teach me something in the process, and keeping me grounded.

    To my friends. You know who you are you lovely bunch. Thank you for the coffees, the gigs, the runs, the laughs, the scran, the wittical silliness, the thoughtful evenings, and the time shared. I couldn't imagine my time in Cambridge without you. There would've been fewer biscuits.

    And to Greg. For the tea.\\

    Lastly, and most importantly, to my family. It's hard to do any justice to how much your love and support means to me and has helped me. Sharing my time at Cambridge with you has made it endlessly more special. Thank you. I love you.\\
