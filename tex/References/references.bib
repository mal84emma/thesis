  abstract = {Reliability-based design optimization of automobile structures for crashworthiness has been studied by many researchers by using either single component probabilistic constraints or single failure mode based probabilistic constraints, while system reliability considerations are mostly disregarded. In this paper, we perform system reliability based design optimization (SRBDO) of an automobile for crashworthiness and analyze the effect of reliability allocation in different failure modes. In addition, effects of various uncertainty reduction measures (e.g., reducing variability in material properties, reducing error of finite element analysis) are investigated and tradeoff plots of uncertainty reduction, system reliability and structural weight are generated. These types of tradeoff plots can be used by a company manager to decide whether to allocate the company resources for employing uncertainty reduction measures or allocating the resources for the excess weight to protect against the unreduced uncertainties. Furthermore, relative importance of automobile structural members in different crash scenarios is quantified.},

A wide range of definitions have been introduced in the literature to characterize smart buildings yet, at present, its' concept and features are not clearly and uniquely defined. Simultaneously, building energy retrofit concept has been introduced to facilitate achieving the nearly Zero-Energy Building target and reduce energy consumption in existing buildings. Up to 90 \% of the existing European building stock will still be standing and in use in 2050. Thus, there is a need to upgrade the existing retrofitting strategies into Smart Retrofitting, to achieve the nearly Zero Energy Building target and be able to respond to external dynamic conditions such as the weather and the grid. The aim of this research is first to review the concept of smartness in the built environment, highlighting the main features, functions, and technologies of smart buildings, also discussing the possible challenges for smart retrofit applications. The second part of the paper reviews the existing Key Performance Indicators that measure the performance and success in achieving goals in smart buildings. The need to develop a quantified guideline to improve energy and technological innovation is the basis for the increase of the smartness in buildings. Consequently, a set of nine groups of representative performance indicators for smart buildings is developed. This work shows current gaps in the literature and highlights the space for foreseeable future research.},

  abstract = {Distributed generation systems (DGSs) are one of the key developments enabling the energy transition. DGSs provide users with increased control over their energy use and generation, but entail greater complexity in their design and operation. Traditionally, optimization models have been used to overcome this complexity, and currently, research is focusing on integrating uncertainties on them. This review attempts to analyze, classify and discuss 170 articles dealing with optimization of DGSs under uncertainty. A survey has been performed to identify the selected manuscripts and the strengths and weaknesses of previous reviews. As a result, an innovative classification has been designed and the distinct elements of optimization models in DGSs have been highlighted: microgrid architecture, sources of uncertainty, uncertainty addressing methods, problem types and formulations, objective functions, optimization algorithms and additional features. Each part is detailed thoroughly to provide an instructive overview of the research output in the area. Subsequently, several aspects of interest are discussed in depth: the future of dealing with uncertainty, the main contributions and trends, and the relative importance of the field. It is expected that this review will be of use to both experts and lay people to learn more about the current state of optimization models in DGSs and provide insights into how to further develop this field.},

Different standards and technological roadmaps propose several technical solutions to mitigate buildings' climate change impact, such as improving existing and new buildings' energy and environmental performance by utilizing Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Energy Storage Systems (ESS). This study aims to examine and quantify the potential of two recommended solutions with a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, including Building-Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) and Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems, to achieve the building decarbonization targets. Therefore, a residential building is analyzed under three different scenarios, and the CO2 equivalent emission alongside the avoided carbon emission and Environmental Payback Period (EPBP) of each scenario are assessed and compared. The result shows that applying a coupled BIPV-TES system in a residential building equipped with electric heat pumps can reduce CO2 eq emission by 21.42\% over 30 years of the building service life.},

This paper provides a survey based on literature and publicly available information of typical appliance PF values and effects at the residential level as well as a discussion on appliance energy use and corresponding operation schedules. A procedure for the calculation of equivalent PF is proposed and exemplified with minutely experimental data at 15minute and hourly time intervals, which correspond to smart metering and traditional practices, respectively. The application of the proposed equivalent PF procedure in coordination with building energy modeling, may, in principle, be employed to determine PF for entire communities at an aggregated level. The paper includes a proposal to simulate reactive power through an approach that utilizes EnergyPlus, a building energy modeling software. Such simulation capability could facilitate improved planning for compensation implementation both in electric power distribution networks and in individual residences, which offers significant opportunity for energy savings.},

  abstract = {The advancement of technology and renewable energy systems (RES) have evolved considerably through the years. Geothermal energy was first introduced in Italy in 1904 and has ever since dramatically increased in efficiency. One of the main types of RES, Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHPs), are used for heating and cooling a space when coupled with Ground Heat Exchangers (GHEs). GSHPs extract or reject heat to the Earth via a network of tubes. The closed loop system, either vertical or horizontal, is the most common of the configurations. Alternatively, pipes can run all the way down to utilize natural underground water sources, when present, in an open loop configuration. GHEs have significantly higher performance over conventional air-to-air heat exchanger systems and the reduction of their cost and the improvement of their overall efficiency through their design are crucial in research. In this paper are presented and reviewed the design aspects of GHE systems. In particular are discussed the types of GHEs such as open or closed loop systems, vertical or horizontal, U-tube or spiral, energy piles and hybrid systems. A comparative analysis through the literature of the various geometrical aspects of GHEs and the geothermal investigation of the ground environment and the materials used in the construction of GHEs are also presented. Then is analyzed the modeling -- experimental and mathematical -- of GHEs, with terms that have been extensively studied, like borehole thermal resistance, thermal characteristics, thermal response test, line-source and cylindrical-source models, discussed in detail. Next a demonstration of designing a numerical model of a GHE system through a software, taking into consideration the thermal characteristics, is given. Finally, a comparative detailed list in the form of a table of more than 30 mathematical and/or experimental GHE studies is provided, focusing on the important factors analyzed and findings of each. The overall aim of the current review study is to help improve the efficiency and the total manufacturing cost of GHEs.},

However, this study goes further by conducting a sensitivity analysis such as capital cost, state of charge and time step, to choose the best system configuration. The results show that, when using the energy storage system composed of pumped hydro, under the load following energy dispatch control, the net present cost and cost of energy are lower with respect to others storage technologies proposed. However, the storage system with the lowest CO2 emissions is lead acid battery using the combined cycle energy dispatch control. In addition, the wind turbines have presented the greatest sensibility in the net present cost with respect to the capital cost variation and pumped hydro-storage present sensitivity response with respect to state of charge. All configurations have different several behaviors, therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of each one are analyzed.},

  abstract = {The comprehensive design of building systems incorporates the tasks of selection, sizing and control of devices. A simultaneous acquirement of these tasks is a necessity to achieve an overall optimal design. However, such mutual optimizations become a complex problem, implying a high computational effort. A greater challenge appears once the uncertainties of boundary conditions such as weather conditions, user demands and energy costs are taken into account. A common approach to protect the suggested system configuration against the possible uncertainties is a stochastic optimization which results in a robust design. In this paper, first the sensitivity of the design to selected boundary conditions is extensively investigated. In a second step, the resulting designs of the deterministic and stochastic optimizations are compared for several uncertainties. All optimizations are setup using a previously developed framework which is extended to solve the stochastic optimization problem. The comprehensive analyses show that the achievement of a robust design is computationally demanding and not even desirable in general. However, the size of devices may vary by up to 100\% when a robust design is attained.},

  abstract = {The problem of planning under uncertainty has many aspects; in this paper we consider the aspect that has to do with evaluating the state of information. We address ourselves to the question of how much better (i.e., how much more profitable) we could expect our plans to be if somehow we could know at planning time what the outcomes of the uncertain events will turn out to be. This expected increase in profitability is the 'expected value of perfect information' and represents an upper bound to the amount of money that it would be worthwhile to spend in any survey or other investigation designed to provide that information beforehand. In many cases, the amount of calculation to compute an exact value is prohibitive. However, we derive bounds (estimates) for the value. Moreover, in the case of operations planning by linear or convex programming, we show how to evaluate these bounds as part of a post-optimal analysis.},

The approach determines the optimal investment timing under conditions of uncertain future revenues and investment cost. It includes time arbitrage of the spot price and profits by providing ancillary services. Current studies of battery banks are limited, because they do not consider the uncertainty and the possibility of operating in both markets at the same time. We confirm previous research in the sense that when a battery bank participates in the spot market alone, the revenues are not sufficient to cover the initial investment cost. However, under the condition that the battery bank also can receive revenues from the balancing market, both the net present value (NPV) and the real options value are positive. The real options value is higher than the NPV, confirming the value of flexible investment timing when both revenues and investment cost are uncertain.},

  abstract = {Implementing an efficient control strategy for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can lead to improvements in both energy efficiency and thermal performance in buildings. As HVAC systems and buildings are complicated dynamic systems, the effectiveness of both data-driven and model-based control methods has been widely investigated by researchers. However, the main challenges that impede the practical application of model-based methods in real buildings are their reliance on the precision of control-oriented models and the dependence of data-based systems on the quantity and quality of input--output data. The objectives of this study are: (1) To present an overview of the prevalent thermal modelling strategies used as control-oriented models or virtual environments in model-based and data-based control methods, addressing the main requirements of thermal models; (2) the state-of-the-art of MPC and RL control techniques; (3) the data requirements for thermal models. The findings emphasise the need for unified guidelines to validate and verify the proposed control methods, ensuring their practical implementation in real buildings. Moreover, the inclusion of occupancy forecasts in models presents challenges due to the intricate nature of accurately predicting human behaviour, occupancy patterns, and their effects on thermal dynamics. Balancing thermal comfort and energy efficiency in HVAC systems with a supervisory controller remains a difficult task, but combining data-driven and physics-based models can help overcome challenges. Further research is needed to compare the effectiveness of MPC and RL approaches, and accurately measuring the impact of human behaviour and occupancy remains a significant obstacle.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews applications of multi-objective optimization approaches for design, control, and the combination of both design and control of a single element or a set of integrated building systems using the current state of the art in building energy modeling and simulation tools. The review provides background on the simulation tools and applicable data-analysis methods currently available to the building industry for both design-oriented and control-oriented optimization approaches of various energy systems. In particular, the analysis presented in this paper reviews the capabilities of these toolsets, as well as their suitability for use by industry professionals, and academic researchers. Reviewed studies show significant annual energy savings and peak load shifting potential for integrated system optimization within buildings. However, the available toolsets and frameworks are not suitable to readily perform multi-objective combined optimizations that integrate a wide range of building energy systems at industry scale. To maximize the efficiency of these systems and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by buildings in accordance with goals set forth by nations across the world, a comprehensive and easy-to-use combined design and control-oriented optimization tool that interfaces easily with geometric architectural design tools is needed for the building simulation industry. Moreover, optimization-based building energy modeling and simulation tools that consider utility driven demand response and peak load management, would be beneficial for designing and operating a built environment that is resilient and sustainable. The case studies reviewed in this paper confirm the limited studies of energy simulation optimizations that have simultaneously analyzed design and control elements of building energy systems prior to construction. This review concludes that there is a need for the development of a more advanced user-friendly tools that integrate both design and control-oriented optimizations of building energy systems to truly transition the building energy industry forward beyond the common code compliance designs.},

  abstract = {The scarcity of land near energy demand poses the challenge of designing multi-functional solar parks in terms of land use in some countries. This requires solutions accounting for multiple conflicting objectives, e.g., power generation and multi-functional use of the land (agricultural, construction, ecological). Moreover, the performance of solar park projects in terms of these criteria is subject to uncertainties, e.g., meteorological aspects impacted by climate change, electricity prices, grid infrastructure availability. In this work we present a framework for multi-objective optimization under uncertainty to aid in the development of smart solar park configurations accounting for multi-purpose land use. A solar park simulator and a techno-economic model are combined to evaluate key performance indicators serving as objective functions. Meteorological uncertainty throughout the park lifetime is characterized through an ensemble of scenarios generated based on the variability of historical data, instead of the current practice of assessing the performance of solar park using a deterministic profile of an average meteorological year. The developed workflow is demonstrated through a case study where power yield and agricultural land use are two conflicting objectives being optimized with the orientation, tilt angle, spacing and height of the modules as the optimization variables. A series of optimization experiments with varying importance weights between the objectives is performed. Obtained solutions show solar park designs which double the available farming area without compromising the levelized cost of energy. These results showcase the value generated through an integrated framework for multi-objective optimization under uncertainty leading to optimized solar parks.},

To that aim a novel approach is presented, that is characterized by the correlation between real time and historical consumption data. The technique has been tested for over a year of operation. Three test cases have been compared (low error load forecasting, higher error load forecasting and correlation-corrected load forecasting) and techno-economic advantages have been obtained with the new approach. Indeed, a reduction of 14,1\% in energy unbalance with~the grid and of 8,7\% in annual operational costs have been obtained when the load forecast correction is performed. Moreover, the critical components of the system (Electrochemical Energy Storage and Fuel Cell) result to work in less stressful operating conditions, another positive effective of the technique.},

  abstract = {Electrifying the energy system and powering it by low carbon electricity is one of the key decarbonisation pathways of the energy system. This study examines annual electricity and gas consumption in a high electrification scenario in Great Britain (GB) and the implications for electricity generation and transmission infrastructure using a suite of soft-linked models. High electrification of heating and transport services, which are two major fossil fuel consumers in GB, increases annual electricity consumption and peak electricity load by 35\% and 93\%, respectively, by 2050 while reducing overall annual energy consumption compared to a reference case. Meeting this high electricity consumption with a supply strategy that is dependent on offshore wind could more than double the supply-side investments required compared to a reference case, if demand-side measures are not available. High electrification would also impact existing gas and oil energy infrastructure by reducing consumption of these fuels. It was found that uncertainties in socio-economic growth can amplify these implications and therefore need serious consideration by analysts and policymakers involved in designing energy transition strategies. A case study and discussion demonstrate that smart-grid aided demand-side management has the potential to minimise electricity peak load and infrastructure requirements from high electrification.},

Capital-intensive infrastructure decisions depend on understanding the likelihoods and impacts of uncertainties such as the timing and stringency of climate policy as well as the technological availability of carbon capture systems. This paper demonstrates the utility of stochastic programming approaches to uncertainty analysis within a practical policy setting, using uncertainties in the US electric sector as motivating examples. We describe the potential utility of this framework for energy-environmental decision making and use a modeling example to reinforce these points and to stress the need for new tools to better exploit the full range of benefits the stochastic programming approach can provide. Model results illustrate how this framework can give important insights about hedging strategies to reduce risks associated with high compliance costs for tight CO2 caps and low CCS availability. Metrics for evaluating uncertainties like the expected value of perfect information and the value of the stochastic solution quantify the importance of including uncertainties in capacity planning, of making precautionary low-carbon investments, and of conducting research and gathering information to reduce risk.},

Using a two-stage stochastic programming approach, model results suggest that the two most critical risks in the near-term planning process of the uncertainties considered here are natural gas prices and the stringency of climate policy. Stochastic strategies indicate that some near-term hedging from lower-cost wind and nuclear may occur but robustly demonstrate that delaying investment and waiting for more information can be optimal to avoid stranding capital-intensive assets. Hedging strategies protect against downside losses while retaining the option value of deferring irreversible commitments until more information is available about potentially lucrative market opportunities. These results are explained in terms of the optionality of investments in the electric power sector, leading to more general insights about uncertainty, learning, and irreversibility. The stochastic solution is especially valuable if decision-makers do not sufficiently account for the potential of climate constraints in future decades or if fuel price projections are outdated.},

Some of the most important decisions we make concern what type and what quality of information to produce. When decisions are fraught with geologic and market uncertainties, this information gathering may such forms as seismic surveys, core and well test analyses, reservoir simulations, market analyses, and price forecasts---which the industry spends billions of US dollars each year. Yet, considerably less time and resources are expended on assessing the profitability or value of this information. Why is that?This paper addresses how to make value-of-information (VOI) analysis more accessible and useful by discussing its past, present, and future. On the basis of a survey of SPE publications, we provide an overview of the use of VOI in the oil and gas industry, focusing on how the analysis was carried out and for which types of decisions VOI analysis has been performed. We highlight areas in which VOI methods have been used successfully and identify important challenges.We then identify and discuss the possible causes for the limited use of VOI methods and suggest ways to increase the use of this powerful analysis tool.},

For each building location, BES requires one year of hourly weather data. Most buildings are designed to last 50+ years, consequently, the building design phase should include BES with future weather files considering climate change. This paper presents a comparative study of two methods to produce future climate hourly data files for BES: Morphing and typical meteorological year of future climate (F-TMY). The study uses data from a high-resolution (9\,km) regional climate atmospheric model simulation of Iberia, spanning 10 years of historical and future hourly data. This study compares both methods by analyzing anomalies in air temperature, and the impact in BES predictions of annual and peak energy consumption for space heating, cooling and ventilation in 4 buildings. Additionally, this study performs a sensitivity analysis of morphing method. The analysis shows that F-TMY is representative of the multi-year simulation for BES applications. A high-quality Morphed TMY weather file has a similar performance compared to F-TMY (average difference: 8\% versus 7\%). Morphing based on different baseline climates, low-grid resolution and/or outdated climate projections leads to BES average differences of 16\%-20\%.},

PyPSA includes models for conventional generators with unit commitment, variable renewable generation, storage units, coupling to other energy sectors, and mixed alternating and direct current networks.

In this paper the basic functionality of PyPSA is described, including the formulation of the full power flow equations and the multi-period optimisation of operation and investment with linear power flow equations. PyPSA is positioned in the existing free software landscape as a bridge between traditional power flow analysis tools for steady-state analysis and full multi-period energy system models.

  abstract = {There are two competing concepts in the literature for the integration of high shares of renewable energy: the coupling of electricity to other energy sectors, such as transport and heating, and the reinforcement of continent-wide transmission networks. In this paper both cross-sector and cross-border integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporally-resolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.},

To do so it requires accurate real-time information on both generation and demand. However, much smaller-scale and highly variable renewable generation is embedded directly in the distribution networks. NG does not have direct metering of how much power this generation is providing at any given time. This lack of knowledge increases the constraint and other costs to keep the system balanced. The problem posed is that of estimating the potential savings of having accurate real-time knowledge of such embedded renewable generation. This report considers two approaches to making such estimates and briefly explores a statistical approach to the modelling of non-constraint costs. Suggestions are made as to what further information might be collected by NG to make improved estimates of the benefits in system operation of direct metering of embedded resources.},

  abstract = {Because physics-based building models are difficult to obtain as each building is individual, there is an increasing interest in generating models suitable for building MPC directly from measurement data. Machine learning methods have been widely applied to this problem and validated mostly in simulation; there are, however, few studies on a direct comparison of different models or validation in real buildings to be found in the literature. Methods that are indeed validated in application often lead to computationally complex non-convex optimization problems. Here we compare physics-informed Autoregressive--Moving-Average with Exogenous Inputs (ARMAX) models to Machine Learning models based on Random Forests and Input Convex Neural Networks and the resulting convex MPC schemes in experiments on a practical building application with the goal of minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort, and in a numerical case study. The building has a water-based emission system and is located in temperate climate. We demonstrate that Predictive Control leads to savings between 26\% and 49\% of heating and cooling energy, compared to the building's baseline hysteresis controller. Moreover, we show that all model types lead to satisfactory control performance in terms of constraint satisfaction and energy reduction. However, we also see that the physics-informed ARMAX models have a lower computational burden, and a superior sample efficiency compared to the Machine Learning based models. Moreover, even if abundant training data is available, the ARMAX models have a significantly lower prediction error than the Machine Learning models, which indicates that the encoded physics-based prior of the former cannot independently be found by the latter.},

  abstract = {Thermal conductivity is required when designing ground heating and cooling schemes, electrical cable conduits and tunnel ventilation. In England these infrastructures are often emplaced within the Chalk. To improve knowledge on chalk thermal conductivity, over the few scattered measured values, estimates have been made from multi-component mixture models based on the mineral composition, porosity and the structure of the Chalk. The range in mid values for the thermal conductivities is 1.78--2.57\>W\>m-1\>K-1 where the lowest values are for the Upper Chalk. Variations in porosity are the main factor for the variation in thermal conductivity. The effect of fracturing is to reduce the bulk thermal conductivity, but the reduction is small for fractures that are saturated. For an averagely fractured chalk with 60\% fracture saturation, the reduction in thermal conductivity is around 22\% for a thermal conductivity of 2.15\>W\>m-1\>K-1. In the near-surface zone, where fracture apertures will be at their greatest and unsaturated conditions may prevail for part of the year, the seasonal variation in thermal conductivity may be significant for infrastructure design.},

This paper presents an area-based modelling approach to heat electrification using 17,741 dwellings in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne as a case study. The presented framework has been developed so as to address local energy policy questions on the impact of domestic electrical heating options. These questions reflect significant under-researched challenges such as the quantification of peak electricity demand for heat pumps based electrification options. The presented results show that the electrification of heat at city-scale will have a substantial impact on the local electrical grid infrastructure and provide a first indication of what the potential additional mean and (winter) peak household electricity demand ranges (i.e. 59--95\%. This is significantly lower than what might be ascertained from existing literature). Furthermore, the results show that emission savings will be achieved with all electrification options studied but achieving the city's ambitious decarbonisation goals will require more exploration of the urban energy landscape. The paper further underpins the significance of sub-city modelling by enabling policy makers to identify housing neighbourhoods at LV sub-station for area-based delivery. Finally, an integrated modelling approach to cope with forthcoming energy system design challenges at LV scale is suggested.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis (SA) is usually carried out along with energy simulations to understand buildings performance and reduce their consumptions. The quality of their results mainly depends on thermal models and input data. Having accurate data about properties and operation conditions of buildings is difficult. In consequence, simulation inputs are affected by uncertainties that may have significant effects on outputs and are important to be considered. Law-driven detailed models are widely used. They ensure reliability and versatility but require a large number of input parameters. The paper addresses the difficulties of getting information from SA using detailed models with existing techniques and proposes a methodology which solves current problems. The methodology consists of using a detailed model of the building, defining and propagating uncertainties of input parameters, calculating macroparameters that characterize the building and getting sensitivity indices. The procedure is applied to the study case of a dwelling in which weather and occupancy are found out to be the strongest parameters on its annual consumption. It should be highlighted that, keeping the structure of inputs with uncertainties required by complex models that defines buildings in detail, the method eases building performance understanding.},

  abstract = {Energy consumption has dramatically increased in buildings over the past decade due to population growth, more time spent indoors, increased demand for building functions and indoor environmental quality, and global climate change. Building energy use currently accounts for over 40\% of total primary energy consumption in the U.S. and E.U. Nevertheless, significant energy savings can be achieved in buildings if they are properly designed, constructed and operated. For this reason, building energy efficiency can provide key solutions to energy shortages, carbon emissions and their serious threat to our living environment. This paper offers a brief overview of building energy-consumption situations, relevant energy-saving approaches, and the influence of global climate change. Building energy-consumption situations based on data derived from international energy reports are initially compared between the U.S., China and the E.U. Both similarities and differences are found in aspects of building energy end-uses and final energy fuel-types among these top three building energy consumers. We then introduce the current concept of the zero-energy building (ZEB). State-of-the-art approaches for ZEB technologies are summarized in three categories: passive energy-saving technologies, energy-efficient building service systems and renewable energy production technologies. The feasibility of these technologies is reviewed. In addition, we briefly discuss the influence of global climate change on the evolution of building energy use in the future. We find that climate change significantly impacts building energy performance, particularly in space heating and cooling. Improvements on building envelope and ventilation can play an important role in reducing space heating and cooling consumption levels. We also provide some suggestions for further developing ZEBs.},

  abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm., Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible., Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

In this paper, we compare the Levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for PEM Reversible Fuel Cells, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, and Lithium-Ion Batteries in three different locations in the United States (Tucson, Seattle, and Rochester) that are characterized by different energy consumption profiles. This research examines three commercial buildings of different sizes: small, medium, and large, with three occupancy profiles: low, medium, and high energy consumption in each of the three locations. The objective is to quantify the impact of uncertain demand and uncertain financial parameters on the LCOS. The results show that all ESSs can represent an attractive alternative to energy curtailment regardless of the building size or the occupancy profile. Further, the results show that fuel cells are a better fit for demand uncertainty as they are more resilient to changes and remain attractive despite that. The uncertainty analysis showed that the minimum LCOS was \$0.049/kWh, and it was for a PEM-RFC in a small building in Tucson under high energy consumption behavior. Oppositely, the maximum LCOS was \$0.679/kWh, and that was for a large building in Seattle under high energy usage occupancy as well.},

Two common challenges afflicting the task are the volatility of the predictions and their computational complexity. We introduce NHITS, a model which addresses both challenges by incorporating novel hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling techniques. These techniques enable the proposed method to assemble its predictions sequentially, emphasizing components with different frequencies and scales while decomposing the input signal and synthesizing the forecast. We prove that the hierarchical interpolation technique can efficiently approximate arbitrarily long horizons in the presence of smoothness. Additionally, we conduct extensive large-scale dataset experiments from the long-horizon forecasting literature, demonstrating the advantages of our method over the state-of-the-art methods, where NHITS provides an average accuracy improvement of almost 20\% over the latest Transformer architectures while reducing the computation time by an order of magnitude (50 times).

Given the UK's 2050 ``Net-Zero'' commitment, decarbonizing heat is becoming urgent and currently one of the main pathways involves its electrification. Here, we present a spatially explicit optimization model that investigates the implications of electrifying domestic heat on the operation of the power sector. Using hourly historical gas demand data, we conclude that the domestic peak heat demand is almost 50\% lower than widely cited values. A 100\% electrification pathway can be achieved with only a 1.3-fold increase in generation capacity compared to a power-only decarbonization scenario, but only by leveraging the role of thermal energy storage technologies without which a further 40\% increase would be needed.},

The feasibility and economic benefits of hybridization are established by comparing the levelized cost of energy of co-located and independently installed assets. A wide range of PV-to-wind capacity ratios and BESS power and energy capacities are investigated, modelling the operation of hybrid and independent configurations over their lifetime. To address the integration of BESS, a mixed-integer linear programming optimization algorithm is employed with an hourly timestep and over-diurnal horizon, adopting a price-taker approach against externally defined wholesale market price timeseries. The main finding is that hybridization noticeably improves the utilization of existing grid infrastructure, constituting an economically advantageous option for a range of PV-to-wind capacity ratios up to 82.5~\% in the case of plain PVs or up to 90--140~\% for BESS-equipped PVs, depending on the duration of integrated storage. When renewable curtailments due to system-level supply-demand equilibrium limitations are also considered, the analysis showcases that hybrid configurations remain competitive while, interestingly, the preferred range of PV capacities is further extended.},

  abstract = {Existing buildings are likely to consume more energy and emit more greenhouse gases than new buildings because of inevitable deteriorations in physical performance. Accordingly, retrofitting of existing buildings is considered essential to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector. However, assessing the energy performance of existing buildings accurately has limitations because building materials undergo physical deterioration and the actual operational conditions differ from as-built documentation. There is also a difference in the level of data acquisition required for building energy performance assessment depending on the conditions of the building. The aim of this paper is to present types of methods for energy performance assessment of existing buildings considering this data acquisition level. We analyzed various assessment methods, which were classified into three prototypes of methods according to the required level of data acquisition. Type 1 assessed the target building based on literature sources. Type 2 conducted on-site audit and assessed the target building based on additional collected data. Type 3 assessed the target building by further estimating the building properties through analysis of the measured energy data. The applicability of the proposed methods were demonstrated using case studies of three buildings located in Seoul, South Korea.},

  abstract = {Local sensitivity analysis (LSA) is widely used for evaluating the uncertainty in a model output or estimated parameters. However, it does not consider the effect of changing parameter values in the parameter space and the simultaneous change of the parameter set. Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) overcomes these limitations of LSA by adequately representing the propagated uncertainty in model usage or parameter estimation. In this study, by using Sobol's method, GSA was conducted to analyze the temporal uncertainty transition of model inputs required in the thermal property estimation via a ground thermal response test (TRT). The obtained results provide important insights; specifically, among the various input parameters, the initial ground temperature and ground volumetric heat capacity account for more than {\textasciitilde}27\% and {\textasciitilde}20\% of the total uncertainty in borehole resistance estimation, respectively. Further, the estimated borehole thermal resistance is larger than intended owing to the uncertainty in the borehole diameter, which is likely to increase during the construction process. Thus, a deterministic estimation by fixing the borehole diameter leads to a lower estimate than the actual resistance. Then, the insights obtained are used to develop a chiller-attached TRT apparatus to overcome the limitations of conventional apparatuses that cannot measure the initial ground temperature accurately. By using the developed apparatus that can accurately control the fluid temperature, the temperature at which the circulating fluid and surrounding soil are in thermal equilibrium can be asymptotically found with an uncertainty range of 0.1~{$^\circ$}C. This improvement in the initial ground temperature accuracy results in a 24\% reduction in the estimation uncertainty of the borehole thermal resistance compared to conventional practice.},

Therefore, a deep learning model with good adaptability (i.e., high performance with little data) is necessary for model predictive control of buildings. Considering the specificity of the building-energy field, we benchmarked six deep learning architectures: the multilayer perceptron, simple recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit (GRU), dilated convolutional neural network, and transformer. Moreover, the data similarity analysis method was developed to analyze the effect of data seasonality on forecasting performance. A publicly accessible data generator and the open-source Python library DeepTimeSeries were used to design a reproducible benchmark. The zone temperatures and thermal loads over a future 24-h period were the forecasting targets. The benchmark results, with varying training dataset sizes from 0.3 to 0.9 y, demonstrated that the transformer architecture performs best, especially on small training datasets. The GRU and RNN were the second- and third-best performers, whereas the rank of other architectures varied depending on the training dataset size and forecasting targets. The similarity analysis revealed that simply increasing the dataset size does not necessarily improve performance, indicating the importance of training with highly similar data for the forecasting period.},

To address these issues, this study introduces a time series similarity assessment method that utilizes TS2Vec, an unsupervised learning-based encoder for extracting time series representation vectors. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated using anonymized datasets of building electricity usage from Cambridge, UK. The proposed methodology stands out for its ability to identify high-similarity data segments by flexibly adjusting the evaluation time window used for extracting representation vectors, outperforming traditional average similarity assessments. Principal component analysis was employed for dimensionality reduction and visualization, alongside a moving window cosine similarity approach to enhance the interpretability of complex multivariate time series data similarities. The study's key findings are as follows. First, dynamic similarity analysis effectively captured the complexity of building energy use patterns. Second, the approach demonstrated the potential to optimize transfer learning by automatically identifying the most suitable source data. Third, the study explored the feasibility of employing dynamic model selection and ensemble techniques based on temporal similarity changes. This study proposes a practical and scalable methodology to mitigate data scarcity and reduce model development costs, thereby facilitating more efficient, adaptive, and accurate energy demand forecasting.},

However, there is currently no standard framework for uncertainty modeling in building energy models. In particular, uncertainty quantification is often based on literature and expert judgment with limited attention on the use of measured data. The purpose of this paper is to provide a structured framework for modeling uncertainties in building energy models. A method for selecting probability distributions based on measured data is presented, allowing users to assign probability distributions that better represents actual data distributions. If measured data is not available, the subjective assignment of an appropriate probability distribution would be based on drawings, specifications, literature and past case studies on uncertainty quantification. To facilitate its implementation to building design and retrofit analysis, an application that couples the proposed framework with EnergyPlus is introduced. Demonstrated through a case study, the proposed framework provides acceptable simulation results in comparison with measured gas and electricity consumption.},

While previous studies showed the applicability of the calibration method to building simulation, its practicality is still impeded by its complexity and the need to specify a whole range of information due to its Bayesian nature. We ease the reader into the practical application of Bayesian calibration to building energy models by providing the corresponding code and user guidelines with this paper. Using a case study, we demonstrate the application of Kennedy and O'Hagan's (KOH) [1] Bayesian calibration framework to an EnergyPlus whole building energy model. The case study is used to analyze the sensitivity of the posterior distributions to the number of calibration parameters. The study also looks into the influence of prior specification on the resulting (1) posterior distributions; (2) calibrated predictions; and (3) model inadequacy that is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions. Results from the case study suggest that over-parameterization can result in a significant loss of posterior precision. Additionally, using strong prior information for the calibration parameters may dominate any influence from the data leading to poor posterior inference of the calibration parameters. Lastly, this study shows that it may be misleading to assume that the posteriors of the calibration parameters are representative of their true values and their associated uncertainty simply because the calibrated predictions matches the measured output well.},

Real-time data were collected from a smart grid that was installed in an experimental building and used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of statistical and ML techniques. Well-known artificial intelligence techniques were used to analyze energy consumption in single and ensemble scenarios. An in-depth review and analysis of the `hybrid model' that combines forecasting and optimization techniques is presented.

  abstract = {This paper includes a review of the different computer tools that can be used to analyse the integration of renewable energy. Initially 68 tools were considered, but 37 were included in the final analysis which was carried out in collaboration with the tool developers or recommended points of contact. The results in this paper provide the information necessary to identify a suitable energy tool for analysing the integration of renewable energy into various energy-systems under different objectives. It is evident from this paper that there is no energy tool that addresses all issues related to integrating renewable energy, but instead the `ideal' energy tool is highly dependent on the specific objectives that must be fulfilled. The typical applications for the 37 tools reviewed (from analysing single-building systems to national energy-systems), combined with numerous other factors such as the energy-sectors considered, technologies accounted for, time parameters used, tool availability, and previous studies, will alter the perception of the `ideal' energy tool. In conclusion, this paper provides the information necessary to direct the decision-maker towards a suitable energy tool for an analysis that must be completed.},

When evaluating the performance of such systems, the parameters are either fixed, or based on generic ranges, or characterized by precise distributions inferred from limited information. These assumptions result in suboptimal designs, for which the actual performance differs drastically from simulations. To address these limitations, we consider the effects of limited information (epistemic uncertainty) on the natural variability (aleatory uncertainty) through probability-boxes. First, we performed a robust design optimization on the natural variability of the levelized cost of exergy, followed by a sensitivity analysis on the effects of limited information on the optimized designs. This paper provides the least-sensitive designs to natural variability and effective actions to reduce the effects of limited information. The results indicate that a photovoltaic-battery-heat pump configuration achieves higher robustness towards aleatory uncertainty than a photovoltaic-battery-gas boiler configuration. To determine the true-but-unknown performance and robustness of the optimized designs, clarifying the grid electricity contract and adopting specific energy demand profiles are the main actions, while considering generic technology models contributes little to the epistemic uncertainty.},

With advent of increasingly powerful computers, it is no longer necessary to represent climatic conditions with a single year of data. Prior studies have shown that a single year of data often do not well represent the range of climate conditions over a period.  This paper proposes a new regime for climatic data representation in buildings---an XMY or eXtreme Meteorological Year---building on a paper from Building Simulation 1999 that called for a common format for building simulation representation. We demonstrate how several sets of international typical meteorological data sets compare to the actual period of record that they represent. Then using an example prototype building, we show that the climatic response of the building would be better served by a range of building climatic data, investigating high and low cases of temperature, humidity, solar radiation and wind conditions.},

  abstract = {Energy performance certificates (EPCs) are ratings of domestic building energy performance mandated across the European Union. Their aim is to provide a reliable assessment of a building's energy performance whilst accounting for non-building effects such as weather and occupancy. Current rating methods, based on theoretical calculations, can introduce significant error from an inability to estimate real building performance. Other methods using real energy data cannot isolate building performance from other effects due to low data resolution. The installation of smart meters in large proportions of the housing stock in European Union member states presents an opportunity. Harnessing high-resolution energy data can create or inform building energy performance ratings with reduced error and at scale. This critical review explores the challenges and opportunities of using smart meter data in building energy ratings, focusing primarily on quantifying the thermal performance of the building and heating system. The research gaps in this emerging field are identified, including: demonstrating that the rating is truly independent of the behaviour of specific occupants; the additional data inputs that add most value in combination with smart meter data; and reducing uncertainty whilst limiting the complexity of the measurement and calculation.},

In the literature, the impact of flexibility has been mainly studied for the optimization of the control logic, assuming that the photovoltaic system and the electric storage have already been installed. Conversely, in this work, we adopt a different perspective that analyses the system from the designer point of view. Different scenarios with a variable degree of flexibility have been created and tested in a residential district considering various demand profiles (i.e., home appliances, heat pumps, and electric vehicles consumption). The profiles have been then used as input for an optimization tool that can design the optimal system according to a specific target function. Firstly, the system has been optimized according to economic indicators. However, results suggested that adopting only an economic perspective in the design phase could lead to results that are not in line with the European environmental targets. Thus, the system has been optimized also considering energy indicators to design a system that could give a relevant contribution to the energy transition of the residential sector. Results suggest that demand flexibility coupled with storage can boost the installation of photovoltaic systems due to the improved economic profitability and at the same time guarantee a relevant contribution to the decarbonization of the sector.},

We begin by articulating a set of overarching principles that can be used to guide ESOM-based analysis. To help operationalize the guiding principles, we outline and explain critical steps in the modelling process, including how to formulate research questions, set spatio-temporal boundaries, consider appropriate model features, conduct and refine the analysis, quantify uncertainty, and communicate insights. We highlight the need to develop and refine formal guidance on ESOM application, which comes at a critical time as ESOMs are being used to inform national climate targets.},

  abstract = {Buildings consume more than 70\% of electricity in the U.S. In order to reduce building energy consumption, advanced building controls have been developed. However, most building controls are using physics-based models and lack of scalability. Recent development of data-driven control models could overcome this challenge and be automatically developed and implemented on large scale. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of automatic and systematic data-driven predictive control (DDPC) for a large-scale real-world deployment. We first used collected data from 78 buildings in RTEM database to train deep neural network models. Then we applied the models to optimize the HVAC control for energy savings. We focused on over 1000 HVAC units in five different commonly used types, including air handling units, rooftop units, variable air volume systems, fan coil units, and unit ventilators. Next, we evaluated the energy-saving potential and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of the proposed method. We found that DDPC was robust and scalable in buildings, with an average energy saving of 65\% and peak load reduction of 15\% compared to current control systems. The average reduction of GHG emissions for CO2, CH4, and N2O was 15.18~kg, 5.76e-4~kg, and 5.48e-5~kg per m2 per year, respectively. New York State can benefit 11\% reduction in carbon emission from DDPC in buildings. For scalability, we also identified and categorized the challenging conditions when DDPC may not work properly and summarized the lessons learned from large-scale DDPC deployment.},

The aerosol (defined as droplets smaller than 5\>{$\mu$}m) resulting from 30\,s of continued speech has O(1\,h) settling time and a viable viral dose an order-of-magnitude higher than in a short cough. The time-of-flight to reach 2\,m is only a few seconds resulting in a viral dose above the minimum required for infection, implying that physical distancing in the absence of ventilation is not sufficient to provide safety for long exposure times. The suspended aerosol emitted by continuous speaking for 1\,h in a poorly ventilated room gives 0.1--11\% infection risk for initial viral loads of  10 8 -- 10 10 \, copies ml l - l , respectively, decreasing to 0.03--3\% for 10 air changes per hour by ventilation.

With the multi-model mean, the increasing trends in cooling energy demand are more pronounced than the decreasing trends in heating. The changes in cooling, however, are highly variable depending on individual simulations, ranging from a few to several hundred percent in most of the densely populated mid-latitude areas.

  abstract = {Attempts to formalize inspection and monitoring strategies in industry have struggled to combine evidence from multiple sources (including subject matter expertise) in a mathematically coherent way. The perceived requirement for large amounts of data are often cited as the reason that quantitative risk-based inspection is incompatible with the sparse and imperfect information that is typically available to structural integrity engineers. Current industrial guidance is also limited in its methods of distinguishing quality of inspections, as this is typically based on simplified (qualitative) heuristics. In this paper, Bayesian multi-level (partial pooling) models are proposed as a flexible and transparent method of combining imperfect and incomplete information, to support decision-making regarding the integrity management of in-service structures. This work builds on the established theoretical framework for computing the expected value of information, by allowing for partial pooling between inspection measurements (or groups of measurements). This method is demonstrated for a simulated example of a structure with active corrosion in multiple locations, which acknowledges that the data will be associated with some precision, bias, and reliability. Quantifying the extent to which an inspection of one location can reduce uncertainty in damage models at remote locations has been shown to influence many aspects of the expected value of an inspection. These results are considered in the context of the current challenges in risk based structural integrity management.},

  abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) technologies offer much promise to the risk management of the built environment, and they are therefore an active area of research. However, information regarding material properties, such as toughness and strength is instead measured in destructive lab tests. Similarly, the presence of geometrical anomalies is more commonly detected and sized by inspection. Therefore, a risk-optimal combination should be sought, acknowledging that different scenarios will be associated with different data requirements. Value of Information (VoI) analysis is an established statistical framework for quantifying the expected benefit of a prospective data collection activity. In this paper the expected value of various combinations of inspection, SHM and testing are quantified, in the context of supporting risk management of a location of stress concentration in a railway bridge. The Julia code for this analysis (probabilistic models and influence diagrams) is made available. The system-level results differ from a simple linear sum of marginal VoI estimates, i.e. the expected value of collecting data from SHM and inspection together is not equal to the expected value of SHM data plus the expected value of inspection data. In summary, system-level decision making, requires system-level models.},

  abstract = {The energy industry has seen a revolutionary transformation in the growth of renewables over the past decade. With recent advances in battery storage performance, solar energy is fast becoming the focus of the global energy shift towards a more sustainable future. Photovoltaic (PV) systems integrated with Battery Energy Storage (BES) systems are expected to play an important role in the UK's future energy industry, aided in part by manufacturing cost reductions. For energy consumers, these systems can deliver considerable savings in utility costs and potentially bring a financial return via a feed-in-tariff (FIT) scheme. Such a system could also help energy suppliers and network operators ease the burden of a huge surge of future energy demand, mitigate network congestion and improve system resilience and autonomy. There is, however, limited literature that utilises simulation to investigate the influence of PV-BES system deployment at urban scale on the grid based on economic and technical analysis. In this work, a household-level model is developed that includes load demand heterogeneities, as well as BES and PV systems. The single household model can be scaled to higher levels, such as streets and community, hence the model can be applied to study the interaction between households, the wider community and the grid, in terms of electricity im/export, BES usage and network injection impact. A comprehensive analysis of both technical and economic perspectives is presented based on several key performance indicators (KPIs), such as self-consumption rate (SCR), self-sufficiency rate (SSR) and reduction in peak charges. The addition of a BES system can significantly increase the self-consumption of a home PV system, by at least 15\%, however the expensive upfront cost of the BES system leads to a much longer payback time.},

  abstract = {It has been proven that advanced building control, like model predictive control (MPC), can notably reduce the energy use and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, despite intensive research efforts, the practical applications are still in the early stages. There is a growing need for multidisciplinary education on advanced control methods in the built environment to be accessible for a broad range of researchers and practitioners with different engineering backgrounds. This paper provides a unified framework for model predictive building control technology with focus on the real-world applications. From a theoretical point of view, this paper presents an overview of MPC formulations for building control, modeling paradigms and model types, together with algorithms necessary for real-life implementation. The paper categorizes the most notable MPC problem classes, links them with corresponding solution techniques, and provides an overview of methods for mitigation of the uncertainties for increased performance and robustness of MPC. From a practical point of view, this paper delivers an elaborate classification of the most important modeling, co-simulation, optimal control design, and optimization techniques, tools, and solvers suitable to tackle the MPC problems in the context of building climate control. On top of this, the paper presents the essential components of a practical implementation of MPC such as different control architectures and nuances of communication infrastructures within supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The paper draws practical guidelines with a generic workflow for implementation of MPC in real buildings aimed for contemporary adopters of this technology. Finally, the importance of standardized performance assessment and methodology for comparison of different building control algorithms is discussed.},

  abstract = {A computationally efficient method to estimate the value of information in the context of subsurface energy resources applications is proposed. The value of information is a decision analytic metric quantifying the incremental monetary value that would be created by collecting information prior to making a decision under uncertainty. It has to be computed before collecting the information and can be used to justify its collection. Previous work on estimating the value of information of geophysical data has involved explicit approximation of the posterior distribution of reservoir properties given the data and then evaluating the prospect values for that posterior distribution of reservoir properties. Here, we propose to directly estimate the prospect values given the data by building a statistical relationship between them using regression and machine learning techniques. For a 2D reservoir case, the value of information of time-lapse seismic data has been evaluated in the context of spatial decision alternatives and spatial heterogeneity of reservoir properties. Different approaches are employed to regress the values on the data: Partial Least Squares Regression and Principal Components Regression regress the values on the important linear combinations of the seismic data. Random Forests Regression is employed to regress the values on a few features extracted from the seismic data. The uncertainty in the estimation of the value of information has been quantified using bootstrapping. Estimating the value of information by simulation-regression is much less computationally expensive than other approaches that fully describe the posterior distribution.},

  abstract = {District heating is an under-researched part of the energy system, notwithstanding its enormous potential to contribute to Greenhouse Gas emission reductions. Low-temperature district heating is a key technology for energy-efficient urban heat supply as it supports an efficient utilization of low-grade waste-heat and renewable heat sources. The low operating temperature for such grids facilitates the integration of seasonal thermal energy storage, enabling a high degree of operational flexibility in the utilization of both uncontrollable and controllable heat sources. Yet, an inherent challenge of optimizing the operation of low-temperature district heating networks and its flexibility is the underlying uncertainty in heat demand. We develop a new stochastic model to minimize the total operational cost of district heating networks with local waste heat utilization, seasonal storage and uncertain demand. We consider in particular how demand side management and seasonal storage can improve the operational flexibility and thereby reduce costs. We analyze different set-ups of a local low-temperature district heating network under development in a new residential area in Trondheim, Norway. We find up to 37\% reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, 29\% generation reduction in peak hours, and 10\% lower operational costs. These large values highlight the significance of flexibility options in low-temperature district heating networks for cost-effective, large-scale deployment.},

To take into account both solar gains and thermal inertia a second order state space model is assumed for a generic building. The Scheme is applied for Almer{\'i}a's climate (South Spain)to a generic building for two different seasons of the year. The impact of forecast accuracy on comfort tracking performance is assessed through a pseudorandom heteroskedastic function. The result is generalized for a community of buildings.

Therefore, this study  aims at assessing the impact of using different predictive models in an energy optimization application for an experimental building. First step in achieving this goal is developing various data-driven models for the investigated building in this study. Afterwards, a framework has been  developed in which the performance of predictive models in the optimization strategy namely Model Predictive Control (MPC) could be evaluated. The results reveal that common indicators in the literature do no suffice to score the performance of models used in MPC, but another state of-the-art indicator; multi-step ahead prediction error is more suitable for evaluating predictive models deployed in MPC.},

  abstract = {Fossil fuels are the main source of space heating in the UK, and therefore climate mitigation implies a systemic change in space heating systems. The challenge is difficult because of an inefficient building stock and high penetration of natural gas. We present new quantified scenarios for residential energy use in the UK to 2050. With minimal policy intervention the UK will remain locked into a gas based heating system, which would conflict with the policy goal of decarbonisation. However, there is a range of scenarios in which this is avoided. A system heavily reliant on heat pumps powered by low carbon electricity is UK policy makers' currently preferred alternative. We conclude that some shift in this direction is likely to be required, but complete reliance on this solution raises a number of problems. Greater use of energy efficiency and biomass can also play a significant role. These options have different risks, but a more diversified strategy would be more prudent. We conclude that the future of UK residential space heating is very uncertain, but meeting low carbon heating goals is better conceptualised as reducing reliance on gas rather than necessarily mass electrification. Our analysis has implications for any country with high use of fossil fuels in space heating and ambitious decarbonisation goals.},

With the development in smart buildings, massive amounts of building operational data are being collected and available for analysis. It is desired to develop big data-driven methods to fully realize the potential of building operational data in energy predictions. This paper investigates the usefulness of advanced recurrent neural network-based strategies for building energy predictions. Each strategy presents unique characteristics at two levels. At the high level, three inference approaches are used for generating short-term predictions, including the recursive approach, the direct approach and the multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) approach. At the low level, the state-of-the-art techniques are utilized for recurrent model development, such as the use of one-dimensional convolutional operations, bidirectional operations, and different types of recurrent units. The performance of different strategies has been assessed from different perspectives based on real building operational data. The research results help to bridge the knowledge gap between building professionals and advanced big data analytics. The insights obtained can be used as guidelines and references for developing advanced deep recurrent models for short-term building energy predictions.},

To help wind energy industries better understand the coordinated operation of BESS and wind farms and its associated profits, this paper develops a simulation model to implement a number of coordination strategies where the BESS supplies enhanced frequency response (EFR) service and enables the time shift of wind generation based on the UK perspective. The proposed model also simulates the degradation of Lithium-Ion battery and incorporates a state of charge (SOC) dependent limit on the charge rate derived from a constant current-constant voltage charging profile. In addition, a particle swarm optimisation-based battery sizing algorithm is developed here on the basis of the simulation model to determine the optimal size of the co-located BESS along with SOC-related strategy variables that maximise the net present value of the wind + BESS system at the end of the EFR contract.},

Demand Side Management (DSM) can be used to shave demand peaks and to avoid bootstrapping highly polluting fast ramp-up generators. This though brings a control problem that is complicated by the increasing diffusion of small-scale, renewable energy sources and local storage facilities which are decentralized and, in general, hard to predict reliably. The overall goal of the control strategy is to balance energy, demand/supply, and to minimize costs. This survey focuses on control strategies to support DSM, considering buildings as the load to be managed. Among the various control strategies, model predictive control (MPC) has a predominant role due to its broad applicability and easy portability to many diverse contexts. The method is suitable for any nonlinear, multi-variable, and linear parameter varying system. The survey provides a general, unifying mathematical characterization of the approaches and lays the foundations for comparing and evaluating MPC-based DSM in buildings.},

Current design optimization methods either employ detailed modelling unsuitable for numerical optimization or use simplified models that do not consider operational conditions. This paper proposes an optimization-oriented model and a non-convex optimization formulation that, differently from other studies in the literature, can consider the influence of the seasonal storage size and temperature on its capacity, losses, heat transfer rate, and efficiency of connected heat pumps or chillers. This methodology was applied to a case study, considering two scenarios: storing only the rejected heat from cooling and integrating solar thermal generation. Results show that, with varying boundary conditions such as the electricity CO2 intensity profile, cooling demand, and price of carbon emissions, not only the optimal seasonal storage size changes but also its optimal operating conditions. The potential reduction of CO2 emissions was found, under standard boundary conditions, to be limited (up to 6.7\%), but an increase in cooling demand and an enhancement of the CO2 intensity seasonal variation led to a reduction of 27.1\%. Integration of solar generation further improved it to 43.7\%, with a comparably small increase in annual cost, up to 6.1\%.},

The implementation of an effective energy transition plan faces multiple challenges, spanning from the integration of the operations of different energy carriers and sectors to the consideration of multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. In this review, we outline these challenges and discuss how they have been tackled by the current literature, as well as pointing at directions for future research. Many of the existing reviews identify a list of challenges common to most models, but they tend to be grouped according to type or energy carrier. Here we take a new approach and structure both well-established models and solution approaches along with the main challenges that energy modelling will have to deal with in the near future. We focus on four main current challenges that energy system models face: time and space; uncertainty; multi-energy; energy behaviour and energy transition. The main findings suggest that: demand-side management applied to multi-carrier energy system models lacks; prosumers is explored only in a limited manner; general, multi-scale modelling frameworks should be established and considered both in the dimensions of time, space, technology and energy carrier; long term energy system models tend to address uncertainty scarcely; there is a lack of studies modelling uncertainties related to emerging technologies and; modelling of energy consumer behaviour is one of the major aspect of future research.},

The perceived requirement for large amounts of data are often cited as the reason that quantitative risk-based inspection is incompatible with the sparse and imperfect information that is typically available to structural integrity engineers. Current industrial guidance is also limited in its methods of distinguishing quality of inspections, as this is typically based on simplified (qualitative) heuristics. In this paper, Bayesian multi-level (partial pooling) models are proposed as a flexible and transparent method of combining imperfect and incomplete information, to support decision-making regarding the integrity management of in-service structures. This work builds on the established theoretical framework for computing the expected value of information, by allowing for partial pooling between inspection measurements (or groups of measurements). This method is demonstrated for a simulated example of a structure with active corrosion in multiple locations, which acknowledges that the data will be associated with some precision, bias, and reliability. Quantifying the extent to which an inspection of one location can reduce uncertainty in damage models at remote locations has been shown to influence many aspects of the expected value of an inspection. These results are considered in the context of the current challenges in risk based structural integrity management.},

Therefore, using demand-side approaches to shift flexible demand over time is a promising opportunity. In the case of electric vehicles, research papers mostly discuss vehicle drivers' individual charging strategies based upon pricing information. The objective of this paper is to quantify the aggregate economic benefit of an advanced metering approach wherein electric vehicle drivers simply provide information about the start of the next trip to the energy supplier, who can then optimize the charging strategy for all drivers based on this information. By using a quantitative model and a multiagent simulation for evaluation, we analyze original data from Germany to conclude that advanced metering can enable significant savings. Finally, we present a pricing scheme that would incentivize the drivers to provide truthful information.},

  abstract = {After a short review of past and present EU green energy programmes, the article deals with the great surging interest on green hydrogen worldwide and the consequent programme of the EU. Considering the trend in the increasing percentage of variable wind and solar plants in the EU, a preliminary evidence on their variability is reported and based on their capacity factors during the different months of last year in France, Spain and Italy. The basic characteristics and `colours' of hydrogen are underlined, and emphasis is placed on the current and future global demand in 2030 and 2050. The expected cost of the energy content of green hydrogen just at the exit of electrolysers (power to gas---P2G) fed by renewable electricity as derived by key international well-recognised organisations is presented. The high cost of hydrogen content of energy at the exit of electrolysers is underlined; even with the 2050 prospective low cost around {\texteuro}1.2/kg of hydrogen, it corresponds to {\texteuro}36/MWh to be compared with the EU present gas market price of {\texteuro}13/MWh that with a penalisation of around {\texteuro}130/t CO2 will reach {\texteuro}36/MWh. Even if the compression, transport and distribution of hydrogen pose important challenges, the article is limited to its production subject to the effects of variability of wind and solar on the performance of large electrolysis plants characterised by a complex balance of plant composed of various subsystems. Based on almost instantaneous data logging from some Italian wind and solar plants, questions are raised about the effects of variability and intermittency on efficiency, flexibility, reduction of the load factor of the electrolyser for its inherent limits. This is relevant due to its minimum load for operation, frequent cold starts, time to ramp up to the operating power. This leads to concerns on the feasibility of operation of an electrolyser plant if it is fed only by a variable and intermittent renewable dedicated plant not connected to the network. Owing to the specific variation versus time of the renewable electricity feeding the electrolyser and of the constraints of hydrogen demand, the cost of hydrogen provided in the literature is only valid for general scenarios. A tailor-made approach case by case for the optimisation and design of the plant appears to be necessary. In contrast the possible smooth behaviour of an electrolyser connected to the grid with power purchasing agreements for electricity from renewable plants spread in the system is analysed; the existing regulations foresee increments in the price of this electricity to remunerate its transport and for ancillary, thus increasing the hydrogen production cost. On the other hand, a better capacity factor could ameliorate the situation but also in this case detailed optimisations are needed. In the conclusions, the still great technological, legal, regulatory and socio-economic challenges for hydrogen production, transport, distribution and final uses are pointed out with the necessity of rigorous analyses and prototypal experiments for a better definition of its market share and relevant timing; specifically it is suggested to concentrate efforts also on a possible new way of operation of electrolysers not as up to now connected to a strong electricity network but fed by RES plants isolated from the grid and characterised by daily, monthly and seasonal variations with time intervals of total lack of electricity at all and sharp up-and-down ramps.},

  abstract = {Electricity generation from renewable energy sources (RES-E) is planned to increase significantly within the coming decades. However, due to uncertainty about the progress of necessary infrastructure investments, public acceptance and cost developments of renewable energies, the achievement of political plans is uncertain. Implementation risks of renewable energy targets are challenging for investment planning, because different shares of RES-E fundamentally change the optimal mix of dispatchable power plants. Specifically, uncertain future RES-E deployment paths induce uncertainty about the level and the steepness of the residual load duration curve and the hourly residual load structure. In this paper, we show how uncertain future RES-E penetration levels impact the electricity system and try to quantify effects for the Central European power market. We use a multi-stage stochastic investment and dispatch model to analyze effects on investment choices, electricity generation and system costs. Our main findings include that uncertainty about the achievement of RES-E targets significantly affects optimal investment and dispatch decisions. In particular, plants with a medium capital/operating cost ratio have a higher value under uncertainty. We find that this technology choice is mainly driven by the uncertainty about the level rather than about the structure of the residual load. Furthermore, given larger investments in plants with medium capital/operating cost ratio under uncertainty, optimal investments in storage units are lower than under perfect foresight. In the case of the Central European power market, costs induced by the implementation risk of renewable energies are rather small compared to total system costs.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a real options model where multiple options are evaluated simultaneously so that the effect of the individual options on each other is accounted for. We apply this model to the electricity sector, where we analyze three typical technologies based on fossil fuel, fossil fuel with carbon capture and renewable energy, respectively. In this way, we can analyze the transition from CO2-intensive to CO2-neutral electricity production in the face of rising and uncertain CO2 prices. In addition, such a modelling approach enables us to estimate precisely the expected value of (perfect) information, i.e. the willingness of investors and producers to pay for information about the correct CO2 price path. As can be expected, the expected value of information rises with increasing CO2 price uncertainty. In addition, the larger the price uncertainty, the larger are the cumulative CO2 emissions over the coming century. The reason for this is that the transition to less CO2-intensive technologies is increasingly postponed with rising CO2 price uncertainty. By testing different price processes (geometric Brownian motion versus jump processes with different jump frequencies), we can also make useful recommendations concerning the importance of policy predictability. We find that it is better to have climate change policies that are stable over a certain length of time and change abruptly than less abrupt but more frequently changing policies. Less frequent fluctuations reduce the expected value of information and result in smaller cumulative CO2 emissions.},

  abstract = {This work proposes a framework for the robust design of multi-energy systems when limited information on the input data is available. The optimal design of a decentralized system involving renewable energy sources and energy storage technologies is considered by formulating a mixed integer linear program that determines the optimal selection, size, and operation of the system to provide energy to an end user, while minimizing its total annual costs and CO2 emissions. Different aspects related to the feasibility and the optimality resulting when operating the multi-energy system on input data different than those used for the design are studied. Input data include weather conditions, energy demands and energy prices. First, considering a single input scenario, we define the resolution required to describe the time profiles of the input data. To do so, we aggregate hourly-resolved yearly time-series through a different number of typical design days, and we define the minimum number of typical design days necessary to obtain feasible and optimal system designs when these are operated on the original input profiles. Next, the uncertainty of weather conditions and energy demands is analyzed. This is described through several scenarios, which are created by combining different climate models, greenhouse gas emissions forecasts and models of buildings. The system configurations obtained with one of these scenarios are evaluated by introducing performance indicators that quantify the robustness and the cost optimality attained when operating the selected design on all other possible scenarios. Furthermore, correlations between performance indicators, structure and size of the system, and relevant characteristics of the input scenarios are identified. Based on this analysis, a robust scenario is defined, which requires information on the average scenario only, and its performance is compared against those of the average and of the worst-case scenarios when used to design a multi-energy system. Several designs are investigated, focusing on the minimization of costs and CO2 emissions, showing that the proposed robust scenario allows obtaining a robust and optimal system design through a deterministic optimization problem, hence maintaining the computation complexity at a minimum. Despite the higher robustness and cost optimality, slightly higher CO2 emissions are observed than the average and the worst-case scenarios. The proposed method is illustrated by performing the optimal design of a multi-energy system providing electricity and heat to a Swiss urban neighborhood, typical of the city of Zurich.},

  abstract = {We provide a detailed estimate of the technical potential of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity generation throughout the contiguous United States. This national estimate is based on an analysis of select US cities that combines light detection and ranging (lidar) data with a validated analytical method for determining rooftop PV suitability employing geographic information systems. We use statistical models to extend this analysis to estimate the quantity and characteristics of roofs in areas not covered by lidar data. Finally, we model PV generation for all rooftops to yield technical potential estimates. At the national level, 8.13 billion m2 of suitable roof area could host 1118 GW of PV capacity, generating 1432 TWh of electricity per year. This would equate to 38.6\% of the electricity that was sold in the contiguous United States in 2013. This estimate is substantially higher than a previous estimate made by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The difference can be attributed to increases in PV module power density, improved estimation of building suitability, higher estimates of total number of buildings, and improvements in PV performance simulation tools that previously tended to underestimate productivity. Also notable, the nationwide percentage of buildings suitable for at least some PV deployment is high---82\% for buildings smaller than 5000 ft2 and over 99\% for buildings larger than that. In most states, rooftop PV could enable small, mostly residential buildings to offset the majority of average household electricity consumption. Even in some states with a relatively poor solar resource, such as those in the Northeast, the residential sector has the potential to offset around 100\% of its total electricity consumption with rooftop PV.},

The current design methods are usually based on deterministic cooling loads, which are obtained by using design parameters or information. However, these parameters contain uncertainties and they will be different from that used in the design calculation when the cooling system is put in use. The actual cooling load profile will deviate from that predicted in design. By considering uncertainties of these parameters, the sizing and configuration of the cooling system can be improved. In this study, a design optimization method is proposed by considering uncertainties related to the cooling load calculation. Impacts caused by the uncertainties of nine factors are considered, including the outdoor weather conditions, internal heat sources and indoor set-points. The cooling load distribution is analyzed. The oversize problem is explained from the viewpoint of uncertainties. By presenting the probability distribution of the cooling load and the potential capital cost, the proposed method can determine the cooling system capacity with quantified confidence. Comparison between the cooling systems with different configurations is also conducted. With the distributions of their energy consumption, decision makers can select the optimal configuration based on quantified confidence.},

With the performance distribution at different risk levels, the design of district cooling systems can be determined by the stakeholders based on the compromise between quantified risk and benefit. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify influential variables with uncertainties for the cooling loads of district cooling systems.

Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) solar panels offer a viable solution while minimising complex construction or excessive infrastructure development. However, critical physical factors influence building suitability to maximise cost-benefit requirements. This research adopted a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach to identify building suitability by analysing and comparing Digital Surface Models (DSM) derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and orthophotography data using UK standardised PV formulas. Geospatial workflows processed rooftop features and modelled outputs for solar irradiation, panel type, kWh, CO2, payback and costs while 3D models and solar web applications were used to validate results. Both models suggested a range of between 14.2 and 15.2 GWh potential for an installed capacity of between 21.1 and 22.3~MW. Residential models met between 62.1\% (LiDAR) and 66.6\% (orthophotography) of average consumer demand with PV potential exceeding 94\% of residential dwellings. LiDAR and orthophotography models had strong agreement with existing PV installations. The methodology can be scaled to a regional level and expanded for larger PV capacity. Moreover, the process can assist policymakers with informed decisions on renewable technologies alongside developments such as Peer to Peer (P2P) solar trading.},

  abstract = {Building energy simulation tools are now being used in a number of new roles such as building operation optimization, performance verification for efficiency programs, and -- recently -- building energy code analysis, design, and compliance verification in the residential sector. But increasing numbers of studies show major differences between the results of these simulations and the actual measured performance of the buildings they are intended to model. The accuracy and calibration of building simulations have been studied extensively in the commercial sector, but these new applications have created a need to better understand the performance of home energy simulations. In this paper, we assess the ability of the DOE's EnergyPlus software to simulate the energy consumption of 106 homes using audit records, homeowner survey records, and occupancy estimates taken from monitored data. We compare the results of these simulations to device-level monitored data from the actual homes to provide a first measure of the accuracy of the EnergyPlus condensing unit, central air supply fan, and other energy consumption model estimates in a large number of homes. We then conduct sensitivity analysis to observe which physical and behavioral characteristics of the homes and homeowners most influence the accuracy of the modeling. Results show that EnergyPlus models do not accurately or consistently estimate occupied whole-home energy consumption. While some models accurately predict annual energy consumption to within 1\% of measured data, none of the modeled homes meet ASHRAE criteria for a calibrated model when looking at hourly interval data. The majority of this error is due to appliance and lighting energy overestimates, followed by AC condensing unit use. These inaccuracies are due to factors such as occupant behaviors and differences in appliance and lighting stocks which are not well-captured in traditional energy audit reports. We identify a number of factors which must be specified for an accurate model, and others where using a default value will produce a similar result. The use of building simulation tools reflects a shift from a component-focused approach to a systems approach to residential code analysis and compliance verification that will serve to better identify and deploy efficiency measures in homes. By better understanding the limitations of home energy simulations and adopting strategies to mitigate the effects of model errors, simulation models can serve as valuable decision making tools in the residential sector.},

Aiming to leverage multiple outputs' correlations while comparing with traditional SOBC in calibration performance and computation cost, we also developed the MOBC model. Compared to including weakly correlated outputs or parameters, the results show that strongly correlated outputs or parameters in MOBC reduce the Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Squared Error (CVRMSE) by 5.56\% and 4.729\% respectively and bring notably better Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) results. Conversely, including strongly correlated parameters in SOBC causes worse model performance. These results reflect that SOBC has parameter identifiability issues that MOBC can solve. The findings contribute to our better understanding of the impacts of (1) output or parameter correlations and (2) different data streams' informativeness on the calibration performance of SOBC and our developed MOBC for BES.},

  abstract = {As outlined in the Paris Agreement on climate change, efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change will require new modes of development of the energy sector including the transformation and expansion of power systems to low-carbon and more resilient designs. However, there is a need for more systematic tools to support decision-making processes in the context of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies for the energy and power sectors. For instance, quantitative approaches should be developed and implemented for the assessment of the impacts and hedging strategies associated with the uncertainties inherent to energy and power planning problems. This study addresses the development and implementation of an integrated model-based system analysis, which uses general circulation models, global sensitivity analysis, and stochastic optimization techniques, for the optimal design and planning of the Colombian power system in view of submitted climate pledges and climate change adaptation. It was found that during the 2015 to 2029 time frame, climate change will likely reduce the capacity factor of hydropower generation by 5.5--17.1\%. Additionally, it was established that the independent effects of three key uncertain parameters, i.e., capacity factor of hydropower generation, gas prices, and emission reduction target, account for {$\sim$}96\% of the variance in the total cost for the required expansion and operation of the power system. Furthermore, when uncertainty is taken into account, the optimal expansion strategy consists of rescheduling of investments in hydropower plants and investing more in carbon management technologies and renewable power plants to compensate for the uncertainty in hydropower generation, climate policy, and gas prices.},

For approach demonstration, a typical office building with multiple zones was utilized as testbed. The study 1) investigated the integrational effect of embedded PIR/CO2 sensors with a smart sensing network on occupancy detection/estimation; 2) field-monitored the energy benefits of an integrated smart sensing/control network in building-operations; and 3) examined the feasibility of further energy reduction via environmental system modeling. Two types of demonstration tests were performed under similar occupancy patterns and weather conditions; a) Baseline Test (3-day) with a normal building-operation following ASHRAE 62.1-2016 requirements, and b) Case Study (3-day) with a smart network-based demand control. Results showed substantial enhancements in occupancy accuracy and energy savings (up to 45\% of fan electricity and 36.5\% of room cooling/heating energy). The new approach provided satisfactory or similar levels of thermal comfort and IAQ. It was analyzed that the use of the environmental system modeling could further reduce the building-operational energy via more detailed control of ventilation.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a building's energy performance is becoming uncertain because of factors such as climate change, the Covid-19 pandemic, stochastic occupant behavior and inefficient building control systems. Sufficient measurement data is essential to predict and manage a building's performance levels. Assessing energy performance of buildings at an urban scale requires even larger data samples in order to perform an accurate analysis at an aggregated level. However, data are not only expensive, but it can also be a real challenge for communities to acquire large amounts of real energy data. This is despite the fact that inadequate knowledge of a full population will lead to biased learning and the failure to establish a data pipeline. Thus, this paper proposes a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that will produce synthetic building energy data. This method is tested on real datasets. The results show that the parameter estimates from the model are stable and close to the true values. The bivariate model gives better performance in classification accuracy. Synthetic data points generated by the models show a consistent representation of the real data. The approach developed here can be useful for building simulations and optimizations with spatio-temporal mapping.},

The problem of optimal scenario reduction consists in determining a probability measure that is supported by a subset of supp P of prescribed cardinality and is closest to P in terms of such a probability metric. Two new versions of forward and backward type algorithms are presented for computing such optimally reduced probability measures approximately. Compared to earlier versions, the computational performance (accuracy, running time) of the new algorithms has been improved considerably. Numerical experience is reported for different instances of scenario trees with computable optimal lower bounds.

We assess the efficacy of Bayesian calibration under a controlled virtual-reality setup, which enables rigorous validation of the accuracy of calibration results in terms of both calibrated parameter values and model predictions. Case studies demonstrate the performance of Bayesian calibration of base models developed from audit data with differing levels of detail in building design, usage, and operation.}

As advancing into the era of digital transformation, the concept of smart buildings emerges as a solution to create sustainable, efficient, resilient, active, and comfortable living and working spaces. This is achieved through intelligent resource use optimization, including the smart management of energy production, storage and distribution systems. Smart buildings operate by harnessing monitoring data and leveraging artificial intelligence algorithms and big data techniques. The integration of monitoring data with contextual information, such as building information modelling, physics, or simulation models, enhances the intelligent management of resources. Moreover, the incorporation of metrics like the smart readiness indicator promotes the adoption of smart buildings. This study delves into the significance of these techniques, expanding on existing research in the field of smart buildings. It integrates concepts of data enrichment, smartness, and user-centric approaches. Key findings provide insights into future opportunities within the sector, emphasizing the need for user awareness strategies, the development of new smart algorithms, and services that incorporate contextual data and the smart readiness indicator. The study also advocates for the widespread adoption of building digital twins.},

This fact has two implications: accurate forecasts of demand are worth more than forecasts of other parameters, and the expected cost of ignoring demand uncertainties exceeds the cost of disregarding other sources of risk. We also investigate the effect of pursuing different objectives under uncertainty.

  abstract = {The information theory developed by Shannon was designed to place a quantitative measure on the amount of information involved in any communication. The early developers stressed that the information measure was dependent only on the probabilistic structure of the communication process. For example, if losing all your assets in the stock market and having whale steak for supper have the same probability, then the information associated with the occurrence of either event is the same. Attempts to apply Shannon's information theory to problems beyond communications have, in the large, come to grief. The failure of these attempts could have been predicted because no theory that involves just the probabilities of outcomes without considering their consequences could possibly be adequate in describing the importance of uncertainty to a decision maker. It is necessary to be concerned not only with the probabilistic nature of the uncertainties that surround us, but also with the economic impact that these uncertainties will have on us. In this paper the theory of the value of information that arises from considering jointly the probabilistic and economic factors that affect decisions is discussed and illustrated. It is found that numerical values can be assigned to the elimination or reduction of any uncertainty. Furthermore, it is seen that the joint elimination of the uncertainty about a number of even independent factors in a problem can have a value that differs from the sum of the values of eliminating the uncertainty in each factor separately.},

  abstract = {Modern buildings are expected to be not only energy efficient but also energy flexible to facilitate reliable integration of intermittent renewable energy sources into smart grids. Estimating the aggregate energy-flexibility potential at a cluster level plays a key role in assessing financial benefits and service area for energy-flexibility services at design stage and determining real-time pricings at operating stage. However, most existing studies focused on the energy flexibility of individual buildings rather than building clusters. In addition, due to the intrinsic uncertainty in building envelope parameters, performance of building energy systems, and occupancy and occupant behavior, it is necessary to quantify the uncertainty in aggregate energy flexibility. In this study, we developed an approach to quantifying the uncertainty in the aggregate energy flexibility of residential building clusters using a data-driven stochastic occupancy model that can capture the stochasticity of occupancy patterns. A questionnaire survey was carried out to collect occupancy time-series data in Hong Kong for occupancy model identification. Aggregation analysis was conducted considering various building archetypes and occupancy patterns. The uncertainty in aggregate energy flexibility was then quantified based on the proposed performance indices using Monte Carlo technique. With the scaling up of building clusters, the estimated energy-flexibility potential became steady and the weekly energy flexibility stayed around 12.40\%. However, the weekly uncertainty of aggregated energy flexibility exponentially decreased from 19.12\% for 8 households to 0.74\% for 5120 households, which means that the estimate of a building cluster's energy flexibility is more reliable than that of a single building.},

  abstract = {Electric-heating integrated energy system (EH-IES) is pivotal for advancing energy structure reforms, and proper planning of EH-IES components can markedly enhance the operation economy, environmental sustainability, and system stability. Nonetheless, the inherent randomness and intermittency of renewable energy sources, along with the peak and valley characteristics of the load, cause output fluctuations in EH-IES energy supply equipment, posing significant threats to system stability. To address these challenges, a multi-objective bi-layer EH-IES planning model considering energy storage system is established, aiming at optimizing both economic performance and stability. This model employs non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) to optimally plans the capacity and location of EH-IES's equipment under 13-node district heating network (DHN), IEEE-33, and IEEE-69 node test systems. Simulation results show that DHN's thermal customer satisfaction is improved by 77.19~\% (7.076~{$^\circ$}C), with the total cost is \$234,310.09/day. For the distributed network (DN), the net load fluctuation is reduced by 1.8491~MW (23.38~\%) and 2.6083~MW (26.16~\%), and the voltage deviation is reduced by 0.3479 p.u. (44.23~\%) and 1.7349 p.u. (61.89~\%), with respective daily costs of \$403.17 and \$898.36. Consequently, the proposed method can improve the cost efficiency and sustainability of the system operation.},

The chapter goes through the fundamentals of algorithms that are essential for the readers to appreciate the various EDA technologies. Many of the EDA problems can be either represented in graph data structures or transformed into graph problems. The most representative ones, in which the efficient algorithms have been well studied, are elaborated. The readers should be able to use these graph algorithms in solving many of their research problems. Heuristic algorithms that yield suboptimal, yet reasonably good results are usually adopted as practical approaches. Several selected heuristic algorithms are also covered. The mathematical programming algorithms, which provide the theoretical analysis for the problem optimality, are explored and the mathematical programming problems that are the most common in the EDA applications are focused on.},

  abstract = {Recently, energy management systems (EMSs) and storage equipment have become increasingly important for optimizing operating schedules to reduce operating costs. Although many previous studies aimed to optimize the operating schedule of energy systems, some considered only perfect predictions for demand and photovoltaic (PV) power generation. In practice, however, predicted values are often different from actual phenomena. Thus, a practical method that can specify how to control each component under the uncertainty is needed. In this paper, we proposed a new optimization strategy to handle the uncertainty and called it the two-time steps recalculation strategy (TtsR). TtsR proposes a framework for problem formulation and functions in combination with an optimization method. Epsilon differential evolution ({$\varepsilon$}DE) was adopted to handle efficiency nonlinear and constraint conditions. TtsR was compared to the all-time steps recalculation strategy (AtsR), which is considered an ideal strategy because it can obtain accurate solutions. The results showed that TtsR required lower computational time than AtsR to obtain a quasi-optimal solution under conditions of unpredicted changes in the power generation and demand; meanwhile, TtsR was able to maintain computational accuracy.},

The uncertainty of future demand and capital cost reduction is modelled by means of a scenario tree configuration, whereas the uncertainty of fuel prices is approached through Monte Carlo simulation. Global environmental concerns have rendered essential not only the satisfaction of the energy demand at the least cost but also the mitigation of the environmental impact of the power generation system. As such, renewable energy penetration, CO2,eq mitigation targets, and fuel diversity are imposed through a set of constraints to align the power generation mix in accordance to the sustainability targets. The model is, then, applied to the Indonesian power generation system context and results are derived for three cases: Least Cost option, Policy Compliance option and Green Energy Policy option. The resulting optimum power generation mixes, discounted total cost, carbon emissions and renewable share are discussed for the planning horizon between 2016 and 2030.},

  abstract = {Power system operators are in search of proven solutions to improve the penetration levels of distributed generators (DGs) in the grid while minimizing cost. This transition is driven, among others, by global climate concerns, the growing power demand, the need for greater flexibility, the ageing grid infrastructure and the need to diversify sources of energy production. Distributed renewables would not easily substitute the conventional electric grid system, perhaps because the latter is a well-established technology and it would not be prudent to abandon it, while the new distributed renewable energy technologies are generally not adequately developed to support the total load. Thus, it is becoming increasingly necessary to consider sustainable options such as integrating renewable energy sources into the existing power grid. This study is a review that is mainly hinged on distributed generation (DG) classification, the challenges of DG to grid integration, practical options used in DG integration, lessons learned from some countries with successful DG to grid integration, push factors in the growth of DGs and the merits of DG to grid integration. These standpoints of DG to grid interconnection are critical in conducting grid planning and operational studies, which should be conducted in strict observance of aspects such as optimal technology selection, optimal capacity and a suitable connection point of DGs in the network. Therefore, the perspectives highlighted regarding DG can assist power system engineers, developers of DG plants and policymakers in developing a power network that is stable, efficient and reliable.},

This study undertakes a systematic review of the literature relating to such models and finds that in only a very small proportion of studies are model uncertainties even considered. This fundamental flaw is due to the computational demands of exploring the output space of such complex models. A more detailed assessment was then undertaken of the identified studies in which uncertainty analysis (UA) and sensitivity analysis (SA) had been applied to BSEMs. The adequacy of the applied methods is discussed, and recommendations proposed for the application of best practice techniques based on the underlying form of the model.},

  abstract = {Multiple uncertainties in the park-level integrated energy system (PIES) can affect the optimal operation of system. Information gap decision theory (IGDT) is a commonly used method of dealing with uncertainty by developing risky strategies to avoid risks or seek risky returns. However, there is no unified method or process for the selection of risk strategies and the setting of related parameters, leading to a certain blindness in the application of IGDT method. A comprehensive risk strategy (CRS)- IGDT approach is proposed for scheduling of PIES considering uncertainties of heat load, photovoltaic output and electric load. Risk averse strategy (RAS) and Risk seek strategy (RSS) scheduling models are constructed. Then an optimized solution method based on adaptive steps ratio (ASR) is proposed to solve the above two models. The CRS and comprehensive risk cost function are proposed from a risk equalization perspective. The target deviation coefficient and steps ratio in the IGDT model are automatically optimized with the objective of minimizing the comprehensive risk cost. Combining the two cases, the average cost reduction is 6.6~\% compared to Risk-neutral (RN), 11~\% compared to RAS-IGDT, and 4.1~\% compared to RSS-IGDT. Moreover, the average costs of CRS-IGDT are lower compared to stochastic programming and robust optimization methods. The experiments verify the generalization and superiority of the proposed method in coping with different information gap situations caused by uncertainty. CRS-IGDT provides new research ideas for dealing with uncertainty problems in PIES and other fields.},

  abstract = {Model uncertainty is a significant source of epistemic uncertainty that affects the prediction of a multidisciplinary system. In order to achieve a reliable design, it is critical to ensure that the disciplinary/subsystem simulation models are trustworthy, so that the aggregated uncertainty of system quantities of interest (QOIs) is acceptable. Reduction of model uncertainty can be achieved by gathering additional experiments and simulations data; however, resource allocation for multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) and analysis remains a challenging task due to the complex structure of the system, which involves decision makings about where (sampling locations), what (disciplinary responses), and which type (simulations versus experiments) for allocating more resources. Instead of trying to concurrently make the above decisions, which would be generally intractable, we develop a novel approach in this paper to break the decision making into a sequential procedure. First, a multidisciplinary uncertainty analysis (MUA) is developed to identify the input settings with unacceptable amounts of uncertainty with respect to the system QOIs. Next, a multidisciplinary statistical sensitivity analysis (MSSA) is developed to investigate the relative contributions of (functional) disciplinary responses to the uncertainty of system QOIs. The input settings and critical responses to allocate resources are selected based on the results from MUA and MSSA, with the aid of a new correlation analysis derived from spatial-random-process (SRP) modeling concepts, ensuring the sparsity of the selected inputs. Finally, an enhanced preposterior analysis predicts the effectiveness of allocating experimental and/or computational resource to answer the question about which type of resource to allocate. The proposed method is applied to a benchmark electronic packaging problem to demonstrate how epistemic model uncertainty is gradually reduced via resource allocation for data gathering.},

Improving renewable energy utilization in buildings is of considerable importance for their carbon neutrality.

This study reviews the current status and future challenges of building electricity use profile models. The paper distinguishes between electricity use profile models and electricity use prediction models. Then it comprehensively reviews current research papers, focusing on four aspects, including the temporal and spatial distribution of datasets, the distinction between statistical and bottom-up modeling methods, mathematical and engineering domain validation metrics, and applications in building energy system design and energy policy making. Key perspectives for future research are discussed in the paper, including the temporal scales of models, the aggregation of electricity use profiles, occupant-driven environment-interactive model structures, as well as the fit-for-purpose model evaluation. This is intended to inform and inspire future research on building electricity use profiles, improve the in-depth understanding and quantitative descriptions of building electricity use, and support the design of future building systems and energy distribution networks.},

With a 50\% probability of implementing stringent carbon mitigation measures after 15 years, the emission trajectory takes the middle path till this uncertainty is resolved. Prior to resolution, electricity supply follows the middle path, natural gas and renewable energy tend to follow the low mitigation trajectory, and oil supply approaches the high mitigation trajectory. A set of specialized hedging technologies has been identified, which emerges more competitive in the hedging strategy than in any of the perfect foresight ones. The paper concludes that such treatment of future uncertainties can give insights that are beyond the scope of an analysis based on deterministic scenarios.},

However, due to the heterogeneous nature of the building stock, developing computationally tractable control-oriented models, which adequately represent the complex and nonlinear thermal-dynamics of individual buildings, is proving to be a major hurdle. Data-driven predictive control, coupled with the ``Internet of Things'', holds the promise for a scalable and transferrable approach, with data-driven models replacing traditional physics-based models. This review examines recent work utilising data-driven predictive control for demand side management application with a special focus on the nexus of model development and control integration, which to date, previous reviews have not addressed. Further topics examined include the practical requirements for harnessing passive thermal mass and the issue of feature selection. Current research gaps are outlined and future research pathways are suggested to identify the most promising data-driven predictive control techniques for grid integration of buildings.},

  abstract = {Currently, the energy grid is changing to fit the increasing energy demands but also to support the rapid penetration of renewable energy sources. As a result, energy storage devices emerge to add buffer capacity and to reinforce residential and commercial usage, as an attempt to improve the overall utilization of the available green energy. Although various research has been conducted in the field including photovoltaic and wind applications, the study on suitability identification of different storage devices for various stationary application types is still the gap observed which needs further study and verification. The review performed fills these gaps by investigating the current status and applicability of energy storage devices, and the most suitable type of storage technologies for grid support applications are identified. Moreover, various technical, economic and environmental impact evaluation criteria's are taken into consideration for the identification of their characteristics and potentials. The comprehensive review shows that, from the electrochemical storage category, the lithium-ion battery fits both low and medium-size applications with high power and energy density requirements. From the electrical storage categories, capacitors, supercapacitors, and superconductive magnetic energy storage devices are identified as appropriate for high power applications. Besides, thermal energy storage is identified as suitable in seasonal and bulk energy application areas. With proper identification of the application's requirement and based on the techno-economic, and environmental impact investigations of energy storage devices, the use of a hybrid solutions with a combination of various storage devices is found to be a viable solution in the sector.},

The proposed approaches are: (a) adaptive robust optimization with unmet demand as the (un)-reliability metric, (b) scenario-based robust satisficing, and (c) stochastic-free robust satisficing. A column-and-constraint generation algorithm is developed to solve the adaptive robust optimization problem. Furthermore, the theoretical connection between the proposed approaches is drawn, and their numerical performances are compared, in terms of optimal solution cost and reliability, through computational experimentation on a realistic case study. Numerical results show that both the computational times and the out-of-sample performances of the optimal solutions obtained from the two proposed robust satisficing approaches outperform that of the adaptive robust optimization approach, providing a strong justification for their application},

In recent years, there has been a rapid deployment of PV and battery installation in residential sector. In this regard, optimal planning of PV-battery systems is a critical issue for the designers, consumers, and network operators due to high number of parameters that can affect the optimization problem. This paper aims to present a comprehensive and critical review on the effective parameters in optimal planning process of solar PV and battery storage system for grid-connected residential sector. The key parameters in process of optimal planning for PV-battery system are recognized and explained. These parameters are economic and technical data, objective functions, energy management systems, design constraints, optimization algorithms, and electricity pricing programs. A timely review on the state-of-the-art studies in PV-battery optimal planning is presented. The challenges, trends and latest developments in the topic are discussed. At the end, scopes for future studies are developed. It is found that new guidelines should be provided for the customers based on various electricity rates and demand response programs. Also, several design considerations like grid dependency and resiliency need further investigation in the optimal planning of PV-battery systems.},

Accurate forecasting of excess electricity generation becomes important for energy traders participating in a liberalised electricity market in order to avoid penalties imposed by the market in case of imbalance between actual and predicted values. This paper proposes a data driven Gaussian process model for forecasting excess generation of electricity. An illustrative study, with a-year long dataset from 287 households, is used to derive the forecasting model. Results show that a-year long data from 18 households is sufficient for accurate prediction of excess generation across a uniform geographic and socio-economic setting.}

We control energy storage system (ESS) to minimize the total electricity bill under the Korea commercial and industrial (KCI) tariff, which both considers peak load and time of use (ToU). Under the KCI tariff, the average peak load, which is the maximum among all average power consumptions measured every 15 min for the past 12 months, determines the monthly base cost, and thus peak load control is extremely critical. We aim to leverage ESS for both peak load reduction based on load prediction as well as energy arbitrage exploiting ToU. However, load prediction inevitably has uncertainty, which makes ESS operation challenging with KCI tariff. To tackle it, we apply robust optimization to minimize risk in a real environment. Our approach significantly reduces the peak load by 49.9\% and the total cost by 10.8\% compared to the case that does not consider load uncertainty. In doing this we also consider battery degradation cost and validate the practical use of the proposed techniques.},

To estimate the impact of NZEBs on the electrical grid, a simulation-based study of an office building with a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) power generation system is conducted. This study assumes that net-metering is available for NZEBs such that the excess on-site PV generation can be fed to the electrical grid. The impact of electrical energy storage (EES) within NZEBs on the electrical grid is also considered in this study. Different levels of NZEB adoption are examined: 20\%, 50\%, and 100\% of the U.S. office building stock. Results indicate that significant penetration of NZEBs could potentially affect the current U.S. electricity demand profiles by reducing purchased electricity from the electrical grid and by increasing exported electricity to the electrical grid during peak hours. Annual electricity consumption of simulated office NZEBs in the U.S. climate locations is in the range of around 94--132\,kWh/m2~yr. Comparison of hourly electricity demand profiles for the actual U.S. demand versus the calculated net-demand on a national scales indicates that the peak percentage difference of the U.S. net-electricity demand includes about 10.7\%, 15.2\%, and 9.3\% for 100\% of the U.S. NZEB stock on representative summer, transition, and winter days, respectively. Using EES within NZEBs, the peak percentage differences are reduced and shifted to the afternoon, including 8.6\%, 13.3\%, and 6.3\% for 100\% of the U.S. NZEB stock on each representative day.},

  abstract = {The control optimization of a variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system requires an accurate electricity load forecast because VRF systems have a wide range of energy consumption owing to part load ratios. Currently, the empirical gray and black-box models are widely used for electricity load forecasting and may not capture the non-linear and dynamic characteristics of VRF system. This paper presents a long short-term memory based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to forecast the multi-step ahead electric consumption of VRF systems according to the state information and control signals. Increasing the depth of the network and the number of neurons per hidden layer cannot improve the performance of the proposed model for testing data up to a limited number of layers, indicating overfitting. This paper presents two methods to address this limitation. First, the feature selection methods were implemented resulting in computationally efficient models with higher accuracies. Pearson correlation and random forest methods were used to identify the relationship among features and thus ascertain both relevant and redundant features. In the second approach, a Bayesian optimization is presented to identify the hyperparameters of a given model that improve the performance of load forecasting. The results demonstrate that the optimized seq2seq model with feature selection is capable to predict the electricity consumption and the daily peak electricity usage reasonably well in a test case of a commercial building with VRF systems. The accurate and robust load forecasting model enables building operators to simulate the operating configurations of VRF system without making physical changes.},

Although many policy makers agree on the uncertainty of the several factors which are involved in the planning of future energy systems, they have yet to consider the risks that their policies will incur, should they fail to meet current carbon emission targets. In this study, we propose a stochastic programming-based energy system model which takes into account various economic and technical uncertainty factors in addition to a chance-constraint, in order to assess the feasibility of meeting carbon emission targets. To determine the chance-constrained programming model efficiently, we propose a solution-based approach which adopts a sample average approximation approach. In addition, we combine the sampling-and-discarding approach with a newly devised heuristic algorithm that is suitable for our proposed model. Furthermore, as it is a numerical study, we apply our model and solution approach to evaluate the long-term capacity expansion plan under the carbon emission target within the Korean electricity sector. Through this numerical study, we verify both the solution quality and computational time of our solution approach, as well as the usability of our model for the trade-off analysis between costs and risks.},

  abstract = {Given the steep rises in renewable energy's proportion in the global energy mix expected over several decades, a systematic way to plan the long-term deployment is needed. The main challenges are how to handle the significant uncertainties in technologies and market dynamics over a large time horizon. The problem is further complicated by the fast-timescale volatility of renewable energy sources, potentially causing grid instability and unfulfilled demands. As a remedy, energy storage and power-to-hydrogen systems are considered in conjunction with energy management system but doing so raises the complexity of the planning problem further. In this work, the long-term capacity planning for a hybrid microgrid (HM) system is formulated as a multi-period stochastic decision problem that considers uncertainties occurring at multiple timescales. Long-term capacity decisions are inherently linked with energy dispatch and storage decisions occurring at fast-timescale and it is best to solve for them simultaneously. However, the computational demand for solving it becomes quickly intractable with problem size. To this end, we propose to develop a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation of the problem and use simulation-based reinforcement learning for multi-period capacity investments of the planning horizon. The MDP includes the policies used for dispatch and storage operation, which are represented by linear programming as a part of the simulation model. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated with a case study, where decisions over multiple decades are considered along with various uncertainties of multi-timescales. Economic and environmental assessments are performed, providing valuable guidelines for government's energy policy.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Recent developments in emerging technologies, ranging from mechanical energy storage to electrochemical batteries and thermal storage, play an important role for the deployment of low-carbon electricity options, such as solar photovoltaic and wind electricity. This chapter details the types of technological learning models to evaluate the experience rates (ERs) for key grid-scale storage technologies, including lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries, pumped hydro storage, and electrolysis and fuel cells. It updates the state of the literature to determine learning rates of these and other grid-scale storage technologies. We discuss methodological issues in determining ERs for grid-scale storage systems, which often provide multiple applications and services on the grid. In addition, the chapter highlights future outlooks and new areas for research, including topics related to learning-by-doing, learning-by-searching, and manufacturing localization to derive further insights. Rapid cost reductions in lithium-ion batteries have the potential to disrupt electricity and transportation sectors, creating further complementarities and innovation cycles. More rigorous data collection for grid-scale storage systems on cost indicators that incorporate multiple services and applications provided by storage, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from storage options, and materials availability of emerging battery chemistries could inform better policies to enable low-carbon power systems.},

  abstract = {Numerical experiments with operation policy optimization for a reservoir fed with a random log normal input demonstrated a negligible sensitivity of results to the assumed form of input distribution, a near optimality of the policy `draft equals input mean' for any reservoir size and any size of input sample used for the policy development, and a similarity between the effects of hydrologic and economic uncertainties. In particular, it was shown that the so-called standard policy, `draft equals target,' arises from any optimal policy as either hydrologic or economic uncertainties grow beyond limits. While there was a clear hierarchy of optimal policies governed by the amount of information underlying the optimization if operation results were assessed vis-{\`a}-vis expected values and the true imput population, the hierarchy was highly distorted when it was judged from the performance of individual policies on a 10-year sample from the true input population, representing an actual future operation period. It was also found that the degree of optimality of a given policy did not depend on the degree to which the underlying input model and its parameters agreed with the true input population, but rather on the similarity of the features of the `historic' sample underlying a given policy and the `future' 10-year sample on which the policy performance was tested.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the near-term analysis of capacity expansion under various uncertainties from the viewpoints of the decision-making process on the optimal allocation of investment and the value of information. An optimization model based on two-stage stochastic programming was developed using real data to describe the Japanese energy system as a case study. Different uncertainty parameters were taken into consideration by a disaggregate analysis of a bottom-up energy modeling approach, including end-use energy demands, plant operating availability and carbon tax rate. Four policy regimes represented as energy planning or policy options were also studied, covering business as usual, renewable energy target, carbon taxation and nuclear phase-out regimes. In addition, we investigated the role of various energy technologies and the behavior of the value of information with respect to the probability function of the worst-case scenario. This value of information provides decision makers with a quantitative analysis for the cost to obtain perfect information about the future. The developed model could be regarded as an applicable tool for decision support to provide a better understanding in energy planning and policy analyses.},

Most models are based on step response of the heat transfer rate, and the superposition principle allows the final solution to be in the form of the convolution of these contributions. The step response is thus a very important tool. Some authors propose numerical tabulated values while others propose analytical solutions for purely radial problem as well as axisymmetric problems. In this paper we propose a new analytical model that yields results very similar to the tabulated numerical ones proposed in the literature. Analytical modeling offers better flexibility for a parameterized design.},

Three energy decision-making examples are presented: ventilation scheduling, heat pump maintenance scheduling, and ground source heat pump design.

Reducing building load uncertainty allows for improved designs with less compromise to be identified, reducing the cost of decarbonizing energy usage. However, the building monitoring required to reduce load uncertainty is costly. This study quantifies the economic benefit of practical building monitoring for supporting energy system design decisions, to determine if its benefits outweigh its cost. Value of Information analysis (VoI) is a numerical framework for quantifying the benefit of uncertainty reduction to support decision making. An extension of the framework, termed 'On-Policy' VoI, is proposed, which admits complex decision making tasks where decision policies are required. This is applied to a case study district energy system design problem, where a Linear Program model is used to size solar-battery systems and grid connection capacity under uncertain building loads, modelled using historic electricity metering data. Load uncertainty is found to have a significant impact on both system operating costs ({\textbackslash}pm30\%) and the optimal system design ({\textbackslash}pm20\%). However, using building monitoring is found to reduce overall costs by less than 2\% on average, less than the cost of measurement, and is therefore not economically worthwhile. This provides the first numerical evidence to support the sufficiency of using standard building load profiles for energy system design. Further, reducing only uncertainty in mean load is found to provide all available decision support benefit, meaning using hourly measurement data provides no benefit for energy retrofit design.},

This study aims to validate the feasibility of a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for commercial building in response to occupancy variations and time-variant electricity prices in comparison to a conventional rule-based control (RBC) strategy. The building energy system included an air-cooled chiller, stratified chilled water thermal energy storage, two fan coil units, three heat exchangers, and five pumps. The optimal operations of the chiller and storage system were determined with the goal of minimizing the operating cost while maintaining the zone temperature at a cooling set point temperature during cooling operation hours. Artificial neural network was utilized as prediction models and metaheuristics algorithm was employed as optimization solver to construct a reliable and computationally manageable MPC controller. The simulation was performed for four days during the cooling season with a confirmed optimal prediction time horizon of 24~h and a control timestep of 1~h intervals. In conclusion, MPC reduced the total operating cost by 3.4\% compared to the RBC, which prioritized the storage system operation to manage the thermal load.},

We develop an optimization model that incorporates all three strategies, and determines the least-cost decarbonization pathway by balancing these levers and leveraging their synergistic relationships. Hourly service demand profiles are established using appliance-level empirical data and the CitySim building energy simulation software. We apply this framework to the residential buildings sector of Austin, Texas, which is a valuable test case due to its ambitious climate policy, rapid population growth, and strong space cooling demand in line with the shift of building energy demand toward warmer regions in the U.S. and globally. Results show that optimal decarbonization relies primarily on the electrification of end-uses and concomitant decarbonization of electricity supply. End-use appliance efficiency plays a comparatively minor role, limited to specific end-uses like lighting, space heating, and water heating. Upgrading building thermal efficiency significantly reduces the cost of climate policy, revealing an important policy complementarity between carbon reduction measures and building energy codes.},

  abstract = {Buildings consume about 41.1\% of primary energy and 74\% of the electricity in the U.S. Better or even optimal building energy control and operation strategies provide great opportunities to reduce building energy consumption. Moreover, it is estimated by the National Energy Technology Laboratory that more than one-fourth of the 713GW of U.S. electricity demand in 2010 could be dispatchable if only buildings could respond to that dispatch through advanced building energy control and operation strategies and smart grid infrastructure. Energy forecasting models for building energy systems are essential to building energy control and operation. Three general categories of building energy forecasting models have been reported in the literature which include white-box (physics-based), black-box (data-driven), and gray-box (combination of physics based and data-driven) modeling approaches. This paper summarizes the existing efforts in this area as well as other critical areas related to building energy modeling, such as short-term weather forecasting. An up-to-date overview of research on application of building energy modeling methods in optimal control for single building and multiple buildings is also summarized in this paper. Different model-based and model-free optimization methods for building energy system operation are reviewed and compared in this paper. Agent based modeling, as a new modeling strategy, has made a remarkable progress in distributed energy systems control and optimization in the past years. The research literature on application of agent based model in building energy system control and operation is also identified and discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {The UK has enacted one of the most ambitious carbon reduction targets striving for net zero emissions by 2050. A major challenge to achieving this is decarbonizing heating demand with almost 25~m homes in need of retrofit. This paper explores a range of retrofit interventions to the English residential stock. These are deployed immediately in 2021 to investigate the maximum carbon reduction that could be achieved. The impact of these interventions on embodied and operational carbon emissions is estimated from 2021 to 2050. The resulting emissions are compared to estimated national carbon budgets, in order to ascertain, if, and with what combination of retrofit measures, the English housing stock can stay within carbon budgets. The results show that mass deployment of air source or ground source heat pumps can reliably achieve combined embodied and operational emissions within national carbon budgets by 2050. The careful selection of insulation materials is key in bringing down the embodied emissions, particularly to meet stricter carbon budgets. The identified scale and pace of deployment thus needed to stay within carbon budgets is likely to pose enormous practical challenges. To overcome these challenges, we argue for (a) urgently increasing both heat pump deployment, and renewable generation targets beyond existing pledges, (b) increasing social awareness of residential retrofit benefits, and (c) providing more attractive financing options to incentivise and facilitate retrofit uptake.},

  abstract = {Multi-horizon forecasting often contains a complex mix of inputs -- including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed in the past -- without any prior information on how they interact with the target. Several deep learning methods have been proposed, but they are typically `black-box' models that do not shed light on how they use the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) -- a novel attention-based architecture that combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and highlight three practical interpretability use cases of TFT.},

Our approach takes into account the uncertainty in solar irradiance forecast over a prediction horizon, using a new probabilistic time series autoregressive model, calibrated on the sky-cover forecast from a weather service provider. In the optimal control formulation, we model the effect of solar irradiance as non-Gaussian stochastic disturbance affecting the cost and constraints, and the nonconvex cost function is an expectation over the stochastic process. To solve this complex optimization problem, we introduce a new approximate dynamic programming methodology that represents the optimal cost-to-go functions using Gaussian process regression, and achieves good solution quality. In the final step, we use an emulator that couples physical system models in TRNSYS with the SMPC controller developed using Python and MATLAB to evaluate the closed-loop operation of a building-integrated system with a solar-assisted heat pump coupled with radiant floor heating. For the system and climate under consideration, the SMPC saves up to 44\% of the electricity consumption for heating in a winter month, compared to a baseline well-tuned rule-based controller, and it is robust, imposing less uncertainty on thermal comfort violation.},

However, there is no strict standard for the selection of uncertainty factors. Too much uncertainty, or not enough of it, is not appropriate for the system optimization. In this paper, a method of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for district energy system is proposed to identify the important uncertainties in the system optimization process. Firstly, the mathematical model of the system is established and the uncertain parameters are screened from technological, economic, environmental and demand-side perspectives. In addition, the selected parameters are divided into two categories according to whether they are time-related, and two methods are adopted to collect samples. Further, a global sensitivity analysis technique is introduced to calculate the sensitivity index of each parameter simultaneously. Case study is performed for a classic district energy system in a typical day of transition season. The sensitivity indexes under different objective functions are also discussed on this basis. The results show that the proposed framework can effectively analyze the uncertain parameters of the system, which can further contribute to the optimal operation decision.},

For larger schemes, the bulk thermal conductivity of the ground surrounding the system is often determined in situ using a thermal response test. Although this test method is commonly used, its limitations are often not fully understood, leading to an over-simplistic interpretation that may fail to identify key facets of the ground thermal behaviour. These limitations are highlighted using data from an instrumented thermal response test carried out in a 150 m deep borehole in east London. It is shown that a single, unique value of bulk thermal conductivity may not be appropriate, as stratification of the ground can lead to differences in thermal performance, depending on the direction of heat flow. Groundwater flow within the Chalk aquifer is also shown to have an important effect on the long-term heat transfer characteristics.},

  abstract = {Digital twin models serve as the most crucial foundation for estimating the expected conservation effects of building energy systems. The establishment of digital twin models relies heavily on the detailed design parameters of building energy systems, including component topology, power, and efficiency. However, a considerable number of existing buildings lack complete modeling parameters. It is challenging to impute the incomplete parameters for building energy systems, since the different building energy systems have different modeling parameters and different amounts of incomplete parameters. To address this challenge, a self-attention variational autoencoder-based method is proposed. Its basic idea is to employ the self-attention mechanism to identify the key parameters within the entire parameters, and to learn the relationships between the incomplete parameters and the key parameters. The method comprises three steps: feature embedding, model building, and supervised learning. The feature embedding is employed to represent the features of building energy systems, with each feature carrying a physical meaning. A self-attention variational autoencoder model is then applied to impute the incomplete parameters based on the available parameters and the relationship between the incomplete parameters and the key parameters. Supervised learning is adopted to train the model based on the principles of the evidence lower bound. The evaluations are conducted using 350 various practical building energy systems sourced from the excellent design atlas in China. Three representative incomplete parameter imputation methods are selected as baseline models for performance comparison. The results indicate that the proposed method exhibits high imputation accuracy, good flexibility, and good interpretability.},

  abstract = {Governments around the world, as well as private industry, invest heavily in remote sensing spacecraft to obtain data about natural and environmental resources, climate change, and the relationship of earth science to human health and quality of life. Numerous studies have been undertaken to describe and measure the value of the data from these spacecraft in order to justify further investments. The studies use a wide variety of methods and generally find a large range of benefits, from quite small to very large, in part because of differences in methodologies. This article offers a general framework for measuring the value of information. The framework serves two purposes. One is provision of a comprehensive and common basis by which to conduct and evaluate studies of the value of earth science. The second is to better inform decision makers about the value of data. Decision makers comprise three communities: consumers and producers of information, public officials whose job is to invest in data acquisition and information development (including sensors and other hardware, algorithm design and software tools, and a trained labor force), and the public at large.},

Renewable resources are 'huge', but our energy consumption is also 'huge'. To compare 'huge' things with each other, we need numbers, not adjectives.Sustainable Energy -- without the hot air addresses the energy crisis objectively, cutting through all the contradictory statements from the media, government, and lobbies of all sides. It gives you the numbers and the facts you need, in bite-sized chunks, so you can understand the issues yourself and organises a plan for change on both a personal level and an international scale -- for Europe, the United States, and the world. In case study format, this informative book also answers questions surrounding nuclear energy, the potential of sustainable fossil fuels, and the possibilities of sharing renewable power with foreign countries.Written by David MacKay, who was an esteemed Professor of Engineering at the University of Cambridge and Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK Department of Climate Change, this is an uplifting, jargon-free and informative read for all. In it, David debunks misinformation and clearly explains the calculations of expenditure per person to encourage people to make individual changes that will benefit the world at large.If you've thrown your hands up in despair thinking no solution is possible, then read this book - it's an honest, realistic, and humorous discussion of all our energy options.},

The system operators and planners are decision makers that need to handle the uncertainty of input data of their models. As an example, energy consumption has always been a critical problem for operators since the forecasted values, and the actual consumption is never expected to be the same. The penetration of renewable energy resources is continuously increasing in recent and upcoming years. These technologies are not dispatch-able and are highly dependent on natural resources. This would make real-time energy balancing more complicated. Another source of uncertainty is related to energy market prices which are determined by the market participants' behaviors. To consider these issues, uncertainty modeling should be performed. Various approaches have been previously utilized to model the uncertainty of these parameters such as probabilistic approaches, possibilistic approaches, hybrid possibilistic-probabilistic approach, information gap decision theory, robust and interval optimization techniques.

Spatially distributed systems also allow for information propagation, i.e. measurements collected at one location can be used to update knowledge at other related locations. In this paper, while restricting our attention to Gaussian random field and binary state models, we illustrate first how sensor placements depend on the decision-making problem to be addressed, as encoded in a problem-specific loss function, and second how the complexity of VoI computations is impacted by this loss function's characteristics. In doing so, we consider several loss functions and present computational techniques for evaluating VoI under them. Finally, we apply these techniques to efficiently optimize sensor placements by the VoI metric in two example applications.},

  abstract = {Optimizing and improving energy performance of buildings while maintaining occupants' comfort are primary goals for building managers. In order to analyze a building's energy performance and make informed retrofit, maintenance, or operational decisions, decision-makers need access to credible real-time data illustrating how building systems are being used by its occupants at a floor and room level granularity. Traditionally, such data has been collected in buildings using wired or wireless systems by installing a dense array of sensors in every building location that needs monitoring. This is an effort and cost-prohibitive approach, especially in existing older buildings where instrumentation and integration with existing building systems is challenging. This paper introduces a novel concept of using autonomous mobile indoor robots for monitoring various occupant comfort and energy parameters inside an existing building, and discusses how the collected data can be utilized in various analyses. The research evaluates the hypothesis that a single multi-sensor fused robotic data mule that collects building energy systems performance and occupancy comfort data at sparse locations inside a building can provide decision-makers with a rich data set that is comparable in fidelity to data obtained from pre-installed and fixed sensor systems. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted using a tele-operated robot outfitted with thermal comfort data collection sensors and a localization camera in a multi-occupancy space within a large university building. The data collected by the mobile robot was statistically compared with data obtained from the building's pre-installed Building Automation System. Experimental results demonstrated the proposed method's promise and applicability in collecting dense actionable data in large spaces using only a sparse set of sensors mounted on mobile indoor robots.},

  abstract = {Energy models are valuable tools that are commonly employed for the optimal design of distributed energy systems (DES). However, the model-based design process of DES can be affected by uncertainty, which can lead to suboptimal design decisions and is introduced by aspects like the stochastic nature of renewables or the unknown future global energy and economy outlook. A critical first step of any effort to examine and incorporate uncertainty in the design process of DES includes the performance of a thorough uncertainty characterisation (UC). The UC task comprises the identification of the sources of uncertainty in the model's parameters and the assignment of a mathematical description to their uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to identify and categorise the most important uncertain parameters in typical DES design models and review the approaches used in the literature to represent their uncertainty. The uncertain aspects investigated pertain to the availability of renewable energy (wind and solar), the economic and environmental dimensions of energy carriers in a DES, the costs and technical characteristics of the technologies composing a DES, and, finally, the uncertain energy demands that a DES must satisfy. The analysis reveals the diversity and the varying complexity levels of the approaches used to characterise each parameter's uncertainty, as well as the specific parameters on which studies in the literature have mostly focused. Additionally, this review can serve to assist modellers who wish to introduce uncertainty considerations in their DES design model with the selection of appropriate UC approaches. Finally, in discussing the results of this review, directions for more effective UC in DES design are discussed, as well as suggestions for the integration of uncertainty in the design process of DES.},

  abstract = {The effective design of Distributed Energy Systems (DES) is subject to multiple uncertainties related to aspects like the availability of renewable energy, the building energy demands, and the energy carrier prices. Nevertheless, current practices involve the use of deterministic design models, which overlook uncertainty and can lead to suboptimal DES configurations that fail to deliver the desired performance. A necessary condition in order to obtain robust DES designs against uncertainty is the understanding of uncertainty's impacts and main drivers. Therefore, this paper presents a novel methodological framework for the investigation of uncertainty in the context of DES design, which combines optimisation-based DES models and techniques from Uncertainty Analysis (UA) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). Moreover, the application of the framework is illustrated with a case study for the optimal DES design of a Swiss urban neighbourhood. Embarking from a deterministic DES design model, first, all sources of uncertainty are identified and appropriate probabilistic descriptions are assigned to all uncertain model parameters. UA is then performed using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to quantify the impacts of uncertainty. Results reveal substantial variations in terms of economic and carbon performance of the optimal DES, but also in terms of optimal DES configurations. Moreover, the UA results indicate that the optimal system costs are mostly higher than the deterministic cost estimates, while the inverse is observed for the case of carbon emissions. Additionally, in many of the MC simulations, the resulting optimal DES configurations deviate significantly from the deterministically obtained designs, which confirms the risk of suboptimal decisions in deterministic design processes. Moreover, the results of UA can function as decision support by identifying the DES configurations that are optimal for most realisations of uncertainty. Finally, to identify the uncertain parameters that are mostly responsible for the variation of the economic performance of the DES, a two-step GSA is launched, combining the Morris method and the variance-based Sobol method. Results of the GSA indicate the energy demand patterns and the energy carrier prices as primarily responsible for the variability of the optimal system cost, while parameters like the investment costs and the technical characteristics of the technologies exert only minimal influence. The results of GSA, besides offering a better understanding of uncertainty to DES designers, also identify the parameters for which additional effort needs to be invested to reduce their uncertainty and, as a result, the uncertainty associated with DES design.},

  abstract = {Smart multi-energy systems based on distributed polygeneration power plants have gained increasing attention for having shown the capability of significant primary energy savings and reduced CO2 pollutant emissions due to the high renewable energy sources penetration. Compared to the traditional power plants, the large variability in the end-user demands (electricity, heat and cold energy), coupled with the uncertainty in the solar and wind energy availability, require the adoption of energy storage systems for dampening the intermittency problems and for performing peak shaving. In a multi-energy system, energy storage technologies typically exist in the form of electrochemical energy and thermal energy storage. Costs and technological limits of energy storage systems are the key parameters that influence the optimal design and operation of the system. In this paper, by adopting an in-house developed simulation tool ({\copyright}E-OPT) based on mixed integer quadratic programming, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out for investigating the techno-economic impact of different storage technologies (i.e. lithium-ion, Vanadium redox, ice and phase change material thermal storage) for optimally designing and operating a multi-energy system. Two case studies, characterized by electricity and peak cooling demand of 1600 kWe and 3000 kWc respectively, have been assessed and the results of master-planning and optimal dispatch discussed for two scenarios, grid-connected and island mode. The results show that multi-energy systems which include combined heat and power units, solar PVs and energy storage systems lead to achieve more than 1.1 \$M and 4.5 \$M savings in net present value and 15\% and 25\% reduction in CO2 emissions, when compared with traditional power plant generation.},

  abstract = {The recent interest in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the recent technical evolution of energy networks to smart grids have facilitated the integration of renewable energy technologies (RETs) into the electricity sector around the world. Although renewable energy provides substantial benefits for the climate and the economy, the large-size deployment of RETs could possibly hurt the level of power system reliability because of the RETs' technical limitations, intermittency, and non-dispatchability. Many power system planners and operators consider this a critical problem. This paper proposes a possible solution to this problem by designing a new stochastic optimization model for the long-term capacity expansion planning of a power system explicitly incorporating the uncertainty associated with RETs, and develops its solution by using the sample average approximation method. A numerical analysis then shows the effects of the large-scale integration of RETs on not only the power system's reliability level but also, and consequentially, its long-term capacity expansion planning. From the results of the numerical analysis, we show that our proposed model can develop a long-term capacity expansion plan that is more robust with respect to uncertain RETs and quantify the capacity the system requires to be reliable.},

  abstract = {The traditional supply chain network planning problem is stated as a multi-period resource allocation model involving 0--1 discrete strategic decision variables. The MIP structure of this problem makes it fairly intractable for practical applications, which involve multiple products, factories, warehouses and distribution centres (DCs). The same problem formulated and studied under uncertainty makes it even more intractable. In this paper we consider two related modelling approaches and solution techniques addressing this issue. The first involves scenario analysis of solutions to ``wait and see'' models and the second involves a two-stage integer stochastic programming (ISP) representation and solution of the same problem. We show how the results from the former can be used in the solution of the latter model. We also give some computational results based on serial and parallel implementations of the algorithms.},

  abstract = {Homes contribute 22\% of UK carbon emissions, 45\% of which are primarily for space heating energy. Delivery of highly insulated homes, new build and retrofit, is needed to help meet the UK's 2050 net zero carbon target. Similar policies are being adopted across the developed world to limit rising carbon emissions. Unfortunately, most new and retrofitted buildings use much more energy than predicted by computer models at design stage, up to 250\% more, the so-called `energy performance gap'. Although emerging evidence suggests that buildings built to the low-energy Passivhaus standard do not demonstrate such a gap, data are often from small-scale forensic investigations. Here, we present the first large-scale systematic evaluation of this standard in occupied buildings using multi-year data from 97 UK Passivhaus dwellings spread across 13 sites. As frequency and type of data collection varies between sites, we adopt a pessimistic approach to the analysis by systematically over-estimating space heating demand in the presence of uncertain data. Results pooled across multiple years, show that mean observed space heating demand is 10.8 kWhm2a-1 (SD 9.1) with no statistically significant difference against predicted demand of 11.7 kWhm2a-1 (p~=~0.43, d~=~-0.1). These results provide powerful evidence in favour of the Passivhaus standard as a reliable means of obtaining low-energy and low-carbon buildings and should be seen in the context that the estimated space heating demand of the average UK home is currently about 145 kWhm2a-1 and a new build home predicted to be 50 kWhm2a-1 and likely to be much more.},

  abstract = {Owing to the high energy consumption in the building sector, appraising the thermal performance of building envelopes is an increasing concern. Recently, a few in situ methodologies to diagnose the thermal parameters of buildings have been considered. However, because of their limitations such as low accuracy, limited number of measurements, and the high cost of monitoring devices, researchers are seeking a new alternative. In this study, a novel hyper-efficient Arduino transmittance-meter was introduced to overcome these limitations and determine the thermal parameters of building envelopes. Unlike conventional methodologies, the proposed transmittance-meter is based on synchronized measurements of different parameters necessary to estimate the transmittance parameter. To verify the applicability of the transmittance-meter, an experimental study was conducted wherein a temperature-controlled box model was thermally monitored, and the outputs of the transmittance-meter employed were compared with those captured by a commercial device. The results revealed a high level of reduction in cost and a low range of difference compared with the latter, thereby validating the applicability of the proposed thermal monitoring system.},

Recent studies on battery energy storage system (BESS) evaluation, sizing and scheduling using energy management system (EMS), have focused on advanced modeling and optimization methods to maximize value streams accumulated across multiple services. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed for EMS of smart home community including BESS, photovoltaic system (PV) and electrical vehicle (EV) with multiple uncertainties based on real behavior of consumers. The suggested algorithm reduces consumers cost by selecting optimal BESS sizes regarding the uncertainty of the market price, power generation of the PV, the amount of charge of the EV and the electricity of the grid. It is so crucial that all uncertainties and consumers' life style are considered to achieve accurate results by taken in to account as double apply both in BESS optimal sizing and EMS of smart home community. Genetic algorithm is used as an optimization method for solving of compatibility -based EMS problem in the community of smart homes considering controllable and uncontrollable loads, and it has been developed for three different cases: on grid, off grid, and off grid in addition to EV connected. The introduced algorithm, by calculating the optimal size of the BESS with state of charge (SOC), not only reduces the consumer cost but also increases their profit by selling excess energy to the grid.},

  abstract = {Designing a reliable and robust micro-grid (MG) aided by energy storage devices requires quantifying the parametric uncertainty associated with input data time-series, among other types of uncertainties -- and in particular, the uncertainty in forecasted meteorological, load demand, and wholesale electricity price time-series. Given the computational complexities involved, the recent battery-storage-supported MG capacity optimisation literature fails to simultaneously characterise multiple sources of data uncertainty. This paper, therefore, seeks to address this knowledge gap by hedging against a wide array of parametric uncertainties at the same time, whilst exploring the potentially salient implications of high-dimensional uncertainty characterisation for the costing and configuration of battery-supported, grid-tied MGs. To this end, this paper introduces a novel computationally efficient, stochastic MG design optimisation model that enables the simultaneous handling of multiple uncertain inputs. Notably, the model yields in-depth, accurate, and robust infrastructure decision-making support, particularly with regard to the optimal size of battery storage, by specifically analysing the worst-case, most likely case, and best-case uncertainty characterisation scenarios. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model within a community renewable energy project scheme, a case study of a grid-connected, battery-storage-supported MG in the town of Ohakune, New Zealand is presented. Importantly, the numerical simulation results indicate that the life-cycle cost of the MG would have been underestimated by as much as {\textasciitilde}8\% (equating to NZ\$0.3~m) in the most likely case -- with an associated {\textasciitilde}15\% (equating to 143 kWh) battery size underestimation -- if the variability inherent in forecast inputs was not factored into the analysis. Also, the proportion of the energy storage capacity to the total renewable power generation capacity is {\textasciitilde}71\%, {\textasciitilde}76\%, and {\textasciitilde}68\% in the best-case, most likely case, and worst-case scenarios, respectively, suggesting that the risk-seeking and risk-averse MG planning strategies have a slightly contradictory effect on the storage-to-generation ratio. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses of different battery technologies with different specific power, specific energy, and depth-of-discharge specifications have also demonstrated the robustness and validity of the model, whilst additionally identifying the sodium-sulfur (NaS) battery technology as the most profitable choice in grid-connected MG development applications -- which can be primarily attributed to the fact that it provides the best trade-off between the specific power and specific energy.},

However, uncertainty is seldom accounted for in the energy planning practice, and robust optimization applications in this field normally consider only a few uncertain parameters. A reason for this gap between energy practice and stochastic modeling is that large-scale energy models often present features---such as multiplied uncertain parameters in the objective and many uncertainties in the constraints---which make it difficult to develop generalized and tractable robust formulations. In this paper, we address these limiting features to provide a complete robust optimization framework allowing the consideration of all uncertain parameters in energy models. We also introduce an original approach to make use of the obtained robust formulations for decision support and provide a case study of a national energy system for validation.},

  abstract = {Many energy policies set a goal of decreasing the carbon emissions of the energy sector by up to 100\%, including the electricity grid. This is a long term and gradual process. Energy systems in cities will likely be the starting point for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation since they account for 80\% of global carbon emissions. This paper analyses the impact on urban districts of decarbonizing the electric grid supply. A multi-objective optimization model has been developed that combines the optimal design and operation of distributed energy systems, the design of district heating (DH), electricity grid constraints based on linearized alternating current (AC) power flow and grid upgrade options. A number of scenarios were defined corresponding to different levels of renewable energy share in the electricity grid. For each scenario, we analyse the changes to the design and operation of the urban energy system, the impact on the district heating potential, and the impact on the operation of the distribution grid as well as the grid upgrade potential. The results showed that the renewable share of the grid has a large impact on the optimal solutions obtained. When the renewable share is below 55\%, a lot of photovoltaic (PV) electricity has to be used to offset the carbon emissions from the grid. Conversely, when the renewable share is above 70\%, the use of PV decreases and heating systems become electrified by producing heat with heat pumps (HP). District heating is used regardless of the renewable share in the grid, but as carbon emissions limits are tightened the potential of DH decreases. Only when the renewable share in the electricity grid is 100\% it is possible to have a carbon-neutral district. In the carbon optimal solutions of each scenario there is no need for DH, but the grid has to be upgraded to enable electrification of the heating system.},

  abstract = {The park-level integrated energy system (PIES), a typical user-side energy supply mode, has developed rapidly in recent years due to its economic and environmentally friendly advantages. Natural gas and part of the electricity of PIES are usually purchased from external gas or power systems and then converted to other forms of energy, such as heating and cooling. However, the uncertainties and correlation of the natural gas price (NGP) and electricity price (EP) bring high risk to PIES planning and may lead to economic deterioration of PIES at the operation stage. Therefore, a risk assessment method for PIES planning is proposed. The marginal distributions of NGP and EP are established by the kernel density estimation method. Then, the copula function is adopted to construct the joint distribution of NGP and EP considering their correlation, according to which the Monte Carlo method is utilized to generate joint scenarios of NGP and EP. On this basis, a risk assessment model considering the uncertainties of energy prices for PIES planning is established, where the conditional value at risk (CVaR) is adopted as the risk measure since it can quantify the impact of extreme uncertainties of energy prices on PIES planning. Case studies show that deepening the degree of multi-energy coupling and the utilization of distributed renewable energy generation can enhance the risk-resistance abilities of the PIES. The proposed method provides an effective tool for decision making related to PIES planning, which can help avoid the risk caused by the uncertainties and correlation of energy prices.},

  abstract = {With the growing adoption of intermittent renewable energy generation the role for energy storage to provide a number of service needs is being increasingly recognised. However, `energy storage' encompasses a family of technologies, each with its own set of performance, cost and physical characteristics, at different stages of development. At the same time, each energy system -- however defined -- has specific needs; and energy systems are themselves part of a wider socio-technical system which has aims beyond the confines of the energy `trilemma'. As energy storage technologies develop, funding is becoming available to demonstrate their application in realistic environments. However, with multiple technical and non-technical factors to consider, it is challenging for many decision makers who often have limited expertise and resources to select which projects to support. In this paper we first describe a novel framework for assessing the wider benefits that could come from deploying energy storage using Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT), a form of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. We then use the framework to assess six potential energy storage projects through a combination of technical analysis and stakeholder input in the county of Cornwall in the UK: a region that has good solar and wind resource with relatively low demand and constrained network infrastructure. The projects assessed were: power to gas, a distributed battery system, battery storage integrated with solar PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay, liquid air energy storage, battery storage integrated with wave energy, and thermal energy storage at a new residential development. We conclude that MAVT can provide a straightforward and user-friendly approach, which can be easily used by decision makers for assessing energy storage projects across a range of criteria and promoting engagement with stakeholders. This approach also allows the subjectivity of decision-making, a potential limitation, to be explored through a sensitivity analysis. The use of MAVT can lead to important insights for the development of energy systems, which in this study included the importance of local priorities to decision-making. In this case, battery storage with PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay was the top-ranking project, performing well across a range of attributes including the maturity of the technology, its ability to defer grid upgrades and economic viability.},

  abstract = {Many domains require the use of sophisticated simulators to adequately model the effect of chosen alternatives on the decision maker's value. Decision support in such complex systems brings unique challenges around efficiency, because simulating each combination of inputs can be time-consuming. In this paper, we conduct a value of information (VOI) analysis to study whether one should purchase information about critical input uncertainties in such complex systems. We propose a novel computational approach, where Gaussian processes are used to model the decision maker's profit as a function of different alternatives and uncertainties. Under this modeling assumption, the expected improvement of the profit is analytically available, which we use to approximate the VOI effectively over batches of simulations, thus avoiding too many computer-intensive evaluations of the system. We illustrate the proposed computational approach with an offshore wind farm maintenance application, where the decision maker relies on outputs from large-scale simulations to determine the optimal vessel fleet mix and number of personnel for operation and maintenance. Such computer-intensive simulations mimic long-term energy production under different input conditions. It is often not possible to explore all the alternatives exhaustively, and one must therefore guide the simulations to run on promising alternatives. We conduct a VOI analysis to study whether one should purchase information about failure rates of wind turbines for this application. The proposed methodologies are general and apply to other domains involving expensive simulators.},

However, typically there are many near-optimal alternatives that stand out due to other attractive properties like social acceptance. Understanding features that persist across many cost-efficient alternatives enhances policy advice and acknowledges structural model uncertainties. We apply the modeling-to-generate-alternatives (MGA) methodology to systematically explore the near-optimal feasible space of a completely renewable European electricity system model. While accounting for complex spatio-temporal patterns, we allow simultaneous capacity expansion of generation, storage and transmission infrastructure subject to linearized multi-period optimal power flow. Many similarly costly, but technologically diverse solutions exist. Already a cost deviation of 0.5\% offers a large range of possible investments. However, either offshore or onshore wind energy along with some hydrogen storage and transmission network reinforcement appear essential to keep costs within 10\% of the optimum.},

  abstract = {With rising shares of renewables and the need to properly assess trade-offs between transmission, storage and sectoral integration as balancing options, building a bridge between energy system models and detailed power flow studies becomes increasingly important, but is computationally challenging. Here, we compare approximations for two nonlinear phenomena, power flow and transmission losses, in linear capacity expansion problems that co-optimise investments in generation, storage and transmission infrastructure. We evaluate different flow representations discussing differences in investment decisions, nodal prices, the deviation of optimised flows and losses from simulated AC power flows, and the computational performance. By using the open European power system model PyPSA-Eur, we obtain detailed and reproducible results aiming at facilitating the selection of a suitable power flow model. Given the differences in complexity, the optimal choice depends on the application, the user's available computational resources, and the level of spatial detail considered. Although the commonly used transport model can already identify key features of a cost-efficient system while being quick to solve, severe deficiencies under high loading conditions arise due to the lack of a physical grid representation. Moreover, disregarding transmission losses overestimates optimal grid expansion by 20\%. Adding a convex relaxation of quadratic losses with three tangents to the linearised power flow and accounting for changing line impedances as the network is reinforced suffices to represent power flows and losses adequately in design studies. We show that the obtained investment and dispatch decisions are then sufficiently physical to be used in more detailed nonlinear simulations of AC power flow evaluating their technical feasibility.},

Distributed intelligence (DI)-based control and management solutions proved a perfect complement to the existing control structures to handle the SES' uncertainty which is getting quite complex with different system layers and involved stakeholders. Advanced modelling and simulation techniques are crucial here to realize and enable the applications of DI to enhance grid reliability while optimize market operation. However, several challenges arise while modelling DI applications and integrating them in the simulation platform due to the complexity of the multi-disciplinary smart grids.

  abstract = {Accessing reliable, clean and affordable energy can be achieved by hybridization of renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar and wind. Such a hybrid photovoltaic~(PV) and wind system along with battery storage (BS) has been considered for this work to realize the concept of Net Zero Energy (NZE) for a group of buildings (NZEBs). Generally, optimal sizing of hybrid PV--Wind system for NZEBs are carried out to ensure the minimum Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and cost with NZE balance constraints. But, the energy transfer between the buildings and grid has not been considered which is a vital parameter in optimal sizing of renewable energy generators for NZEBs. In NZEBs, over sizing/under sizing of renewable energy generator leads to greater energy export/import between the building and grid, which eventually increases burden on the electrical grid. So, in this work, minimization of total energy transfer (TET) is considered as the third objective function along with LPSP and cost to minimize the grid burden. A Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) has been utilized for optimization of three objective functions such as annualized cost of the system (ACS), LPSP and TET, which are conflicting and incomparable. Based on the proposed sizing technique, the size of hybrid PV--Wind generators and BS capacity are determined from the pareto front solutions. To exemplify the reduced grid burden by reducing the TET, the results of proposed three objective function sizing technique are compared with the results of two objective function (cost and LPSP) sizing technique and analyzed for two different conditions of LPSP. The results confirm that the reduced TET has been achieved through the proposed sizing technique.},

  abstract = {In response to climate change and sustainability challenges, various incentive programs have increased solar photovoltaic (PV) generation interconnection in the low voltage electrical distribution system. However, electric utility support of PV generation is limited by reverse power flow into the electricity network at high penetration levels. This limits the ability to achieve Zero Net Energy (ZNE) behind individual meters and in whole communities. In parallel, district level energy systems, and Advanced Energy Communities (AEC) that include storage, offer a great prospect for integrating high levels of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) into the built environment. Optimally designing such systems to serve communities, commercial, and industrial loads, while maximizing the penetration of solar PV, has been a challenge to Distribution System Operators (DSO) and city planners. This paper proposes a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) optimization to decide the best DER portfolio, allocation, and dispatch, for an AEC that achieves ZNE and islanding while respecting electrical grid operational constraints, with a focus on distribution transformer overloads. The main strategies to avoid transformer overloads were found to be judicious sizing and siting of battery energy storage and also optimally re-distributing PV throughout the community, which increased the ability of the electric infrastructure to support a PV deployment that is 1.7 times larger than the existing transformer capacity without the need for infrastructure upgrades. This work highlights the importance of including local infrastructure capacities, such as distribution transformer constraints when developing projects that result in high renewable penetration throughout the distribution network.},

  abstract = {The scheduling of a hydropower plant is challenging because of inflow uncertainty. During spring there is increased uncertainty when the snow melts. By gathering snow measurements, one learns more about the future inflow, and this might lead to lower spillage risk or higher efficiency. In this paper the value of information of snow measurements is studied. The value of information is representative of how much a test is worth. If the price of acquiring and processing snow measurements is less than the value of information, the test is worth doing. The notion of value of information is also useful for comparing various kinds of snow measurements in different situations. For scheduling a least squares Monte Carlo method is used in this paper. The uncertain inflow is represented by discrete scenarios, while the time-varying spot price is assumed known. Data from a Norwegian power plant are used to fit the inflow and snow distributions as well as prices, water reservoir limits and production release alternatives. The numerical tests show that snow measurements have little value when the reservoir is large compared to the total inflow. When the reservoir is smaller, the probability of overflow is bigger, and the snow measurements can be valuable for the scheduling when the data have high accuracy. The increase in value by using the snow measurements is between 0 and 10\% in the different parameter settings considered here.},

We expose how the results are highly dependent on the assumptions used, and how the investment Nash--Cournot game with perfect and complete information implies such a degree of coordination between players that the outcome of the game would be classified by any regulation law as collusive behavior.

  abstract = {Occupant behaviors (e.g., switch/dim lights, adjust thermostat, etc.) have a big impact on building energy consumption. However, the occupant behavior in buildings is not well understood and oversimplified. In addition, a majority of current researches just focused on the occupant number variation and ignored the temporal variation (e.g., the occupant presence duration and arrive/leave time). This paper aims to use a whole building simulation program (i.e., EnergyPlus) to investigate the impacts of spatio-temporal occupant behaviors on residential building energy usage utilizing a simple static schedule-based behavior model through uncertainty analysis (UA) and sensitivity analysis (SA). A residential prototype building EnergyPlus model with two thermal zones from the U.S. Department of Energy is used for the case study. The chosen building type is a single-family detached house with three locations in U.S. 3000 EnergyPlus Monte Carlo simulations using a Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve (KL) expansion based sampling method for each location is conducted. Occupancy behaviors related parameters including thermostat setpoints, occupancy and lighting schedules are randomly perturbed using a KL truncated expansion, which results in a 3.76\% overall average coefficient of variation of selected input parameters. UA with such perturbation shows about a 4\% impact on the HVAC annual and peak energy consumption, Annual building and HVAC electricity consumption, and hourly peak building and HVAC electricity consumption are selected for the study of impacts of the spatio-temporal occupant behaviors on building energy usage using Sobol and PEAR sensitivity index. SA Results show that thermostats setpoints have big influences on residential building energy usage.},

  abstract = {Building energy systems represent a significant and largely untapped demand-side grid resource. Buildings use about 75\% of electricity in the United States, including around 80\% of peak demand, meaning that changes in building energy use have significant implications for grid operations. Building energy technologies-including energy-efficient devices, flexible loads, and energy storage-can be coordinated and aggregated to perform similar functions as centralized grid assets. Recent advances in information and communication (ICT) technologies have significantly improved building energy technology automation, coordination, and aggregation capabilities. With declining costs and technological advances, building energy systems can increasingly compete with conventional grid assets such as natural gas plants. Building energy technologies enable the deployment of distributed solar photovoltaics (DPV). Energy-efficient buildings allow DPV to meet greater shares of building load while flexible loads and energy storage can reshape building load profiles to optimize the on-site use of DPV. Optimized on-site use of DPV increases the value proposition for DPV adoption and can help utilities cost-effectively integrate higher levels of DPV penetration. Together, DPV and building energy technologies could help grids achieve deep decarbonization more quickly and cost-effectively.},

Then, a large amount of recent SA case studies in BPA were reviewed. The critical information regarding the implementation of a SA, such as the sampling method, the SA method, etc., were extracted and summarized. Next, an extensive analysis was performed to evaluate the role of the SA in the BPA. This includes: 1) The typical selection of the input and output parameters for the SA were visualized; 2) The uncertainty level and sampling strategies for the input parameters were investigated; 3) The principles, benefits, and drawbacks of the SA methods were analyzed and summarized; and 4) The various tools used in the SA, including the simulation software, sampling tools, and SA tools were introduced to facilitate the practitioners. Lastly, several conclusions were summarized on the role of the SA in the BPA. Suggestions were also provided to offer practical solutions to the current challenges.},

The options for carbon emission reductions are grouped into (1) generation of secondary energy carriers, (2) end-use energy sectors and (3) sector interdependencies. The challenges on the way to a decarbonized energy sector are identified with respect to environmental sustainability, security of energy supply, economic stability and social aspects. A global carbon tax is the most promising instrument to accelerate the process of decarbonization. Nevertheless, this process will be very challenging for humanity due to high capital requirements, the competition among energy sectors for decarbonization options, inconsistent environmental policies and public acceptance of changes in energy use.},

Here, a method capable of determining the continuum containing all economically near-optimal solutions is presented, moving the field of energy system modeling from discrete solutions to a new era where continuous solution ranges are available. The proposed method is applied to study a range of technical and socioeconomic metrics on a model of the European electricity system. The near-optimal region is found to be relatively flat allowing for solutions that are slightly more expensive than the optimum but better in terms of equality, land use, and implementation time.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes the factors leading to the deployment of Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH2) within the optimal design of district-scale Multi-Energy Systems (MES). To this end, we utilize an optimization framework based on a mixed integer linear program that selects, sizes, and operates technologies in the MES to satisfy electric and thermal demands, while minimizing annual costs and CO2 emissions. We conduct a comprehensive uncertainty analysis that encompasses the entire set of technology (e.g. cost, efficiency, lifetime) and context (e.g. economic, policy, grid carbon footprint) input parameters, as well as various climate-referenced districts (e.g. environmental data and energy demands) at a European-scope. Minimum-emissions MES, with large amounts of renewable energy generation and high ratios of seasonal thermal-to-electrical demand, optimally achieve zero operational CO2 emissions by utilizing PtH2 seasonally to offset the long-term mismatch between renewable generation and energy demand. PtH2 is only used to abate the last 5--10\% emissions, and it is installed along with a large battery capacity to maximize renewable self-consumption and completely electrify thermal demand with heat pumps and fuel cells. However, this incurs additional cost. Additionally, we show that `traditional' MES comprised of renewables and short-term energy storage are able to decrease emissions by 90\% with manageable cost increases. The impact of uncertainty on the optimal system design reveals that the most influential parameter for PtH2 implementation is (1) heat pump efficiency as it is the main competitor in providing renewable-powered heat in winter. Further, battery (2) capital cost and (3) lifetime prove to be significant as the competing electrical energy storage technology. In the face of policy uncertainties, a CO2 tax shows large potential to reduce emissions in district MES without cost implications. The results illustrate the importance of capturing the dynamics and uncertainties of short- and long-term energy storage technologies for assessing cost and CO2 emissions in optimal MES designs over districts with different geographical scopes.},

We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities.

Its time-varying power output is difficult to model credibly because it depends on complex and variable weather systems, leading to difficulty in understanding its potential and limitations. We demonstrate how the MERRA and MERRA-2 global meteorological reanalyses as well as the Meteosat-based CM-SAF SARAH satellite dataset can be used to produce hourly PV simulations across Europe. To validate these simulations, we gather metered time series from more than 1000~PV systems as well as national aggregate output reported by transmission network operators. We find slightly better accuracy from satellite data, but greater stability from reanalysis data. We correct for systematic bias by matching our simulations to the mean bias in modeling individual sites, then examine the long-term patterns, variability and correlation with power demand across Europe, using thirty years of simulated outputs. The results quantify how the increasing deployment of PV substantially changes net power demand and affects system adequacy and ramping requirements, with heterogeneous impacts across different European countries. The simulation code and the hourly simulations for all European countries are available freely via an interactive web platform, www.renewables.ninja.},

  abstract = {The decarbonization of electric power systems plays a critical role in global endeavors to mitigate climate change and facilitate the transition towards a sustainable energy future. In this context, green hydrogen has emerged as a promising and nascent clean energy solution, showing substantial potential for addressing the prevailing energy and environmental challenges on a global scale. This paper proposes an integrated energy hub (IEH) operational model to produce green hydrogen from biomass. This model includes renewable photovoltaic and wind sources, biomass electrolyzers, batteries, and hydrogen storage systems (HSS). To effectively manage the uncertainties stemming from renewable sources, electricity and hydrogen demand, and energy prices, an Information Gap Decision Theory-based normalized weighted-sum (IGDT-NWS) approach is proposed. For the first time, this approach solves multi-objective problems with operation costs, carbon emissions, and the energy export index while accounting for uncertainties to mitigate adverse impacts. The planning obtained for IEH with a risk-averse strategy, where the critical deviation factor is 0.1, is robust against the maximum prediction error of electricity demand, hydrogen demand, the output of PV and WT, and the electricity price of 5~\%, 1.24~\%, 10~\%, 7.06~\%, and 17.2~\%, respectively. With a risk-seeker strategy, our proposed method can optimistically reduce operation cost by 10~\% with the deviation of 4.83~\%, 5.86~\%, 10~\%, 0~\%, and 5~\%, respectively. Moreover, this study emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating HSS into the battery energy storage system (BESS). The results show that the proposed model decreases IEH operation cost by 35.29~\%, reduces environmental impact by 33.37~\%, and improves EEI by 71.6~\%, compared with using BESS only.},

  abstract = {Increasing complexity of building energy systems has led to a wide range of methods to minimise cost of meeting demand for all types of energy. Metaheuristics and mixed integer linear programmes (MILP) are the two most prevalent optimisation methods in the field, with relative advantages which have not previously been compared under common criteria. The principle objective of this paper is to scrutinise these two optimisation methods when applied to a problem of finding the optimal operational schedule of an energy system serving a hotel. 11 technologies are modelled by both methods, but all exhibit nonlinear characteristics which must be linearised for use in MILP. Comparison of the two models results in variation between objective function below 1\%, where piecewise linearised MILP gives the most optimal solution. The time to solution varies by orders of magnitude between models: 0.08s for simple linear MILP, 1.64s for piecewise linear MILP and 274s for metaheuristic. System designers, or controllers, must decide between solution time and realistic representation of technologies when choosing an optimisation method, a compromise which may be balanced by piecewise optimisation. Further, Proposed operation schedules vary slightly between methods, allowing some subjectivity in exact operation schedule, without compromising objective function. Metaheuristics favours qualitative subjectivity, while MILP favours quantitative subjectivity.}

  abstract = {Current district energy optimisation depends on perfect foresight. However, we rarely know how the future will transpire when undertaking infrastructure planning. A key uncertainty that has yet to be studied in this context is building-level energy demand. Energy demand varies stochastically on a daily basis, owing to activities and weather. Yet, most current district optimisation models consider only the average demand. Studies that incorporate demand uncertainty ignore the temporal autocorrelation of energy demand, or require a detailed engineering model for which there is no validation against real consumption data. In this paper, we propose a new 3-step methodology for handling demand uncertainty in mixed integer linear programming models of district energy systems. The three steps are: scenario generation, scenario reduction, and scenario optimisation. Our proposed framework is data-centric, based on sampling of historic demand data using multidimensional search spaces. 500 scenarios are generated from the historical demand of multiple buildings, requiring historical data to be nonparametrically sampled whilst maintaining interdependence of hourly demand in a day. Using scenario reduction, we are able to select a subset of scenarios that best represent the probability distribution of our large number of initial scenarios. The scenario optimisation step constitutes minimising the cost of technology investment and operation, where all realisations of demand from the reduced scenarios are probabilistically weighted in the objective function. We applied these three steps to a real district development in Cambridge, UK, and an illustrative district in Bangalore, India. Our results show that the technology investment portfolios derived from our 3-step methodology are more robust in meeting large possible variations in demand than any model optimised independently with a single demand scenario. This increased robustness comes at a higher monetary cost of investment. However, the high investment cost is lower than the highest possible cost when each of the initial 500 scenarios is optimised independently. In both our case studies, building level energy systems are always more robust than district level ones, a result which disagrees with many existing studies. The outcomes enable better examination of district energy systems. In addition, our methodology is compiled as an open-source code that can be applied to optimise existing and future energy masterplans of districts.},

  abstract = {District energy systems are an alternative to conventional national-scale networks to meet demand in urban areas. Decentralising electricity production reduces distribution losses, while centralising thermal energy production capitalises on economies of scale. Furthermore, geographic proximity facilitates the use of waste heat from electricity production to meet thermal demand. However, it is difficult to assess which configuration of technologies will best suit a cluster of users. Mathematical optimisation techniques have been extensively researched as a method to resolve this, as they can simplify the design of investment portfolios and operation schedules for a given set of geolocated demands. However, they are not yet practically applicable. This thesis uses the open-source, mixed integer linear programming framework Calliope to present three methodological enhancements which address model simplification, parameter uncertainty, and conflicting decision-maker objectives. These enhancements enable the practical design of district energy systems through data-centric workflows which can readily represent real system complexities in a tractable optimisation model. This thesis first examines the impact of parameter simplification in a linear model. Piecewise linearisation is applied to nonlinear part-load energy consumption curves and a pre-processing step is developed to optimise breakpoint positioning along a piecewise curve. Second, a three-step method is proposed to handle demand uncertainty in linear models, using historical demand data. These steps are scenario generation, scenario reduction, and scenario optimisation. Using out-of-sample tests, robustness of optimal investments to unmet demand is quantified. Furthermore, system resilience to unexpected events is explored by introducing interruptions to the national electricity grid availability for a district in Bangalore, India. Scenario optimisation is extended to account for these interruptions as well as to mitigate unfavourably high levels of CO\$\_2\$ emissions in system design. Finally, this thesis identifies eight possible decision makers, who each hold a different objective in the design of a district energy system. Optimal technology configuration and out-of-sample test results are compared across all decision-maker objectives. These methodological enhancements demonstrate the capability of optimisation models to be reflective of reality whilst being transparent concerning the impact of simplifications, uncertainty, and conflicting objectives. Calliope is extended in this thesis to be practically applicable for district energy systems. Moreover, its extensibility facilitates the continuation of development, including possible future work into data validation and spatial dimension simplification.},

  abstract = {The need to design resilient energy systems becomes ever more apparent as we face the challenge of decarbonising through reliance on non-dispatchable technologies and sectoral integration. Increasingly, modelling efforts focus on improving system resilience, but fail to quantify the improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel workflow that allows increases in resilience to be measured quantitatively. It incorporates out-of-sample testing following optimisation, and compares the impacts of demand and power interruption uncertainty on both risk-unaware and risk-aware district energy system models. To ensure we encompass the full range of impacts caused by uncertainty, we consider nine distinct objectives encompassing differences in: investment and operation costs, CO2 emissions, and aversion to risk. We apply the workflow in a case study in Bangalore, India, and demonstrate that scenario optimisation improves system resilience by one to two orders of magnitude. However, systems designed for resilience to demand uncertainty are not able to gracefully extend to managing risk from extreme shocks to the system, such as power interruptions. We show that shock-induced instability can be addressed by specific measures to reduce grid dependence. Finally, by studying out-of-sample test results, we identify an objective which balances cost, CO2 emissions, and system resilience; this balance is achieved by novel application of the Conditional Value at Risk measure. These results expose the need for out-of-sample testing whenever uncertainty is considered in energy system modelling, and we provide the framework with which it can be undertaken.},

  abstract = {The energy consumption of cities is increasing fast due to growing global population and rapid urbanization. Urban Building Energy Models (UBEMs) are promising tools to simulate the energy demand of buildings under different urban scenarios. Nowadays, the major barriers to the effective use of UBEMs are the uncertainty related to their input parameters and the lack of good-quality, open energy consumption data. The latter make deterministic UBEM simulations unreliable, and calibration approaches unsuitable for most cities in the world. The present work proposes to combine physics-based UBEMs with Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis on the main input parameters using aggregated data on energy use from regional/national statistics. The proposed procedure selects the most influential input parameters and characterizes their uncertainty through Forward Uncertainty Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis to obtain stochastic load profiles for space heating and cooling. The method was first tested against hourly thermal power profiles metered on a heterogeneous sample of buildings in Verona (Italy). The average heating load profile obtained is significantly improved compared to deterministic, archetype-based simulations in terms of energy needs and peak loads. The overestimation of residential buildings peak load is reduced from 80\% to 25\%, and the deviation in the energy needs calculation drops from 18\% to 10\%. The proposed simulation procedure was then applied to a district of Milan (Italy), including more than 600 buildings, resulting in similar variations. Overall, the results demonstrate that considering the uncertainty of operational, geometrical and physical parameters is of the utmost importance to obtain reliable urban simulations.},

When assessing building performance, simulation software relies on typical meteorological year (TMY) data to represent long-term climate conditions. This study provides the first comprehensive review of TMY datasets for building applications. An extensive analysis of 530 publications from 1978 to 2023 was conducted to extract the present status of the existing TMY databases, conventional methods, advancements, critical research gaps, and potential future directions to enhance the TMY representativeness for building energy simulation. The TMY improvement methods were analyzed based on the simulation parameters, measured outcomes, and evaluation metrics. The review reveals limitations in existing TMY databases, including sparse station data, fixed weighting schemes, and failure to account for microclimate or abrupt climate change. The study identifies four key research areas to develop more accurate and representative TMY datasets for sustainable building applications: (1) expanding case study scales, (2) refining meteorological parameters, (3) improving data pre-processing techniques, and (4) enhancing validation strategies for the TMY improvement methods. This study offers a holistic view of TMY generation for building applications, and implementing its recommendations can advance building energy research for sustainable design strategies and operation practices.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of ⩾1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to long-term prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building's schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network (RNN) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep NN to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building's load profiles, the proposed RNN sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi-layered perceptron model.},

  abstract = {Transfer Learning (TL) is currently the most effective approach for modeling building thermal dynamics when only limited data are available. TL uses a pretrained model that is fine-tuned to a specific target building. However, it remains unclear how to proceed after initial fine-tuning, as more operational measurement data are collected over time. This challenge becomes even more complex when the dynamics of the building change, for example, after a retrofit or a change in occupancy. In Machine Learning literature, Continual Learning (CL) methods are used to update models of changing systems. TL approaches can also address this challenge by reusing the pretrained model at each update step and fine-tuning it with new measurement data. A comprehensive study on how to incorporate new measurement data over time to improve prediction accuracy and address the challenges of concept drifts (changes in dynamics) for building thermal dynamics is still missing. Therefore, this study compares several CL and TL strategies, as well as a model trained from scratch, for thermal dynamics modeling during building operation. The methods are evaluated using 5--7 years of simulated data representative of single-family houses in Central Europe, including scenarios with concept drifts from retrofits and changes in occupancy. We propose a CL strategy (Seasonal Memory Learning) that provides greater accuracy improvements than existing CL and TL methods, while maintaining low computational effort. SML outperformed the benchmark of initial fine-tuning by 28.1{\textbackslash}\% without concept drifts and 34.9{\textbackslash}\% with concept drifts.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption curtailment is believed to be one of the effective techniques to mitigate the effects of high PV penetration on the power system operation. This study investigates the impact of PV self-consumption curtailment on Building to Grid (B2G) operations based on a parameter ``g''. The performance parameters of B2G system include; building's electricity cost, PV Self-consumption Ratio (PV-SCR), grid's Load Factor (LF), ramp rate control and voltage regulation. In this regard, two strategies, (1) PV self-consumption curtailment with Demand Response (DR) and, (2) PV self-consumption curtailment without DR are compared. These strategies represent optimized and un-optimized B2G frameworks, respectively. In optimized framework, model predictive based optimization is performed that uses the synergy of Energy Storage System (ESS) and Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system to extend its demand flexibility to provide DR service. Furthermore, this study introduces a B2G index (IB2G) which is a weighted sum of building's electricity cost and grid's LF, and is used as a metric for compromising distinct objectives of building and grid. To investigate how selection of g effects the B2G performance parameters, case studies were conducted based on three different values of g, i.e., 100\%, 60\% and 40\%. Simulation results of optimized B2G framework revealed that g at 60\% is more appropriate with cost saving up to 20.34\%, IB2G minimization beyond 17.7\% and PV-SCR improvement of 46\% compared to un-optimized framework.},

The proposed model characterizes a typical year with eight representative scenarios and obtains the optimal energy management for the station and BESS operation to exploit the energy arbitrage for each scenario. Contrasting extant literature, this paper proposes a constant power constant voltage (CPCV) based improved probabilistic approach to model the XFCS charging demand for weekdays and weekends. This paper also accounts for the monthly and annual demand charges based on realistic utility tariffs. Furthermore, BESS life degradation is considered in the model to ensure no replacement is needed during the considered planning horizon. Different from the literature, this paper offers pragmatic MILP formulations to tally BESS charge/discharge cycles using the cumulative charge/discharge energy concept. McCormick relaxations and the Big-M method are utilized to relax the bi-linear terms in the BESS operational constraints. Finally, a robust optimization-based MILP model is proposed and leveraged to account for uncertainties in electricity price, solar generation, and XFCS demand. Case studies were performed to signify the efficacy of the proposed formulations.},

The underlying uncertainty is modeled using probabilistic theory. In this method, the expected value of the objective function is evaluated using numerical approaches. A simulation based optimization method is presented which can estimate the cost of system operation and find the appropriate design by means of stochastic programming. The effect of minimum economic turn-down of the facilities is also discussed in this paper. The optimum capacity of distributed generation technologies has a great effect on the cost of the building. Therefore, the proposed method is applied for a hospital in Iran as a case study. The results show that the optimum capacities of CHP and absorption chiller decreases and the capacities of the electric chiller and boiler rise by an increase in demand uncertainty. In addition, the appropriate minimum economic turn-down of facilities has a considerable effect on the overall system cost.},

Archetype solutions can help to reduce the necessary data to model buildings in the urban context. Nevertheless, additional data and Bayesian calibration can be used to reduce the uncertainty in estimated parameter values. We model and calibrate three office buildings in Germany with different information levels using one year of hourly measurements. Starting with an archetype building energy model (BEM), the facade area and orientation, the window share, the physical properties, and the heating times are specified gradually before calibrating. The calibrated models are evaluated in CV(RMSE) and R2 and put in the context of ASHRAE Guideline 14 [1]. The calibration results with more specified parameters in the initial BEM are absorbing less error, because of the eliminated uncertainty before the calibration. Furthermore, the calibration of the most advanced BEM is performed with different periods of real measurement data. The calibrated BEMs indicate a similar data fit for calibrations with three months of measurement data from quarter 1, 2, and 4 of the year and with semi-annual measurement data.},

To create such an offer, the contractor has to provide an energy consumption threshold and a measurement plan. This article aims to draw some recommendations to choose an appropriate approach to provide the information necessary to create the contract, regarding computation time budget, expected accuracy and type of information provided. To get these results, we couple thermal simulations to various uncertainty and sensitivity methods. We first compare screening and differential sensitivity to reduce the number of inputs of the statistical study. Then, we analyze various uncertainty analysis methods to set an appropriate energy consumption threshold, considering the input uncertainties and the study context (Quadratic combination, directional and importance sampling and reliability methods). Sensitivity analyses in various input spaces are then carried out to identify the most critical contributors to energy levels to create the measurement plan. Finally, two metamodeling approaches are tested to reduce the overall computational time: Kriging and sparse polynomial chaos. These methods are tested and compared on a 4000~m{$^2$} office building in Nantes, France. The resulting recommendations can be applied to any building, depending on the model regularity, the number of uncertain parameters and the objective of the study.},

Potential decisions can range from the installation of demand-side measures to the replacement of energy supply systems and combinations therewithin. The classical decision theories of Wald, Savage, and Hurwicz are used to perform non-probabilistic optimisation under both technical and economic uncertainty.

The wind speed Wiebull distribution is estimated, and the solar irradiance distribution is obtained using a novel approach based on the sky cloudiness parameter. Moreover, to simulate the performance of the hybrid system components according to the actual conditions, their availability is calculated using failure and repair rates. The optimal size of the proposed hybrid system is calculated considering, for the first time, the reliability and system costs. The system's size is optimized through the consideration of key decision variables, including photovoltaic panel area, rated power, wind turbine tower height, and battery capacity. Two distinct optimization methods are employed: a single-objective approach utilizing Genetic Algorithm, where the total system cost is minimized with reliability as a constraint, and a double-objective approach using NSGA-II, considering both initial cost and reliability as objectives. The optimal system size is determined through an efficient decision-making process. A practical case study is conducted, monitoring wind speed, solar irradiance, and electricity demand of a residential building at 15-minute intervals over a year. The results reveal the efficacy of the optimization methods, with the single-objective approach yielding a total system cost of {\texteuro}75,495 and reliability of 95.19\%, while the double-objective optimization achieves a cost of {\texteuro}73,460 and a reliability of 91.88\%.},

Thermal comfort is of utmost importance in office buildings, which need the activation of heating systems at an optimal time.

A set of key performance indicators (KPIs) was improved by studying the output performance. The effect of normalization and standardization preprocessing techniques on NN prediction ability was studied. Learning curves showed that a minimum of 1--4 months of data are required to obtain enough accuracy. Two heating seasons provide the optimal data size to calibrate the NN properly with high prediction accuracy. The results also revealed that building data from {$\geq$}two years slightly improve NN performance. The most accurate results in KPIs ({$\geq$} 90\%) were obtained with preprocessed data.

It gives the reader a solid foundation for formulating and solving many kinds of probability problems for deriving additional results that may be needed in order to address more challenging questions, as well as for proceeding with the study of a wide variety of more advanced topics. Great care is devoted to a clear and detailed development of the `conceptual model' which serves as the bridge between any real-world situation and its analysis by means of the mathematics of probability. Throughout the book, this conceptual model is not lost sight of. Random variables in one and several dimensions are treated in detail, including singular random variables, transformations, characteristic functions, and sequences. Also included are special topics not covered in many probability texts, such as fuzziness, entropy, spherically symmetric random variables, and copulas. Some special features of the book are:  a unique step-by-step presentation organized into 86 topical Sections, which are grouped into six Parts over 200 diagrams augment and illustrate the text, which help speed the reader's comprehension of the material short answer review questions following each Section, with an answer table provided, strengthen the reader's detailed grasp of the material contained in the Section problems associated with each Section provide practice in applying the principles discussed, and in some cases extend the scope of that material an online separate solutions manual is available for course tutors.  The various features of this textbook make it possible for engineering students to become well versed in the `machinery' of probability theory. They also make the book a useful resource for self-study by practicing engineers and researchers who need a more thorough grasp of particular topics.},

  abstract = {Manufacturing enterprises are facing the need to align themselves to the new information technologies (IT) and respond to the new challenges of variable market demand. One of the key enablers of this IT revolution toward Smart Manufacturing is the digital twin (DT). It embeds a ``virtual'' image of the reality constantly synchronized with the real operating scenario to provide sound information (knowledge model) to reality interpretation model to draw sound decisions. The paper aims at providing an up-to date picture of the main DT components, their features and interaction problems. The paper aims at clearly tracing the ongoing research and technical challenges in conceiving and building DTs as well, according to different application domains and related technologies. To this purpose, the main questions answered here are: `What is a Digital Twin?'; `Where is appropriate to use a Digital Twin?'; `When has a Digital Twin to be developed?'; `Why should a Digital Twin be used?'; `How to design and implement a Digital Twin?'; `What are the main challenges of implementing a Digital Twin?'. This study tries to answer to the previous questions funding on a wide systematic literature review of scientific research, tools, and technicalities in different application domains.},

  abstract = {Big Data applications are typically associated with systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and storage architectures. The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.},

Techno-economic performance of BIPV system with appropriate energy storage has been evaluated for grid power supply limits with appropriate energy tariff for minimizing the annualized energy cost. It has been assumed that the capital costs associated with PV has been included in the building mortgage and expected that in the near future, the grid power supply limits would be introduced and therefore the BIPV house owner may need to install the battery with additional investments and it may affect the techno-economic performance of the BIPV energy system. It has been observed that during month-wise appropriate grid power supply limits, battery with BIPV system can perform much better through energy throughput compare to other reported scenarios. The correlation analysis has been presented for techno-economic performance indicators and observed that there is a strong correlation among PV energy production and grid energy supply. Correlation analysis among the technical and economic performance indicators may be useful for techno-economic of BIPV system.},

One of the common challenges caused by these changes is flexibility necessity of energy resources. One of the best solutions to mitigate this challenge is energy storage systems (ESSs) utilisation. The main question is how to determine size, site, and type of ESSs to maximise their benefits. This study reviews the answers to this question according to the research studies. This study first classifies the studies related to ESS expansion planning into two main categories from the viewpoint of the power system operators and the investors. Next, the first main category is divided into three subcategories: ESS expansion planning in microgrids, distribution networks, and transmission networks. The second main category is classified into two subcategories: ESS expansion planning aim to smooth RESs output power and to maximise profit. In each subcategory the modelling approaches, solving methods, and the results are evaluated. Finally, based on the existing challenges, the future research directions of ESS expansion planning are outlined.},

  abstract = {The renewable-plus-storage power plant is becoming economically viable for power producers given the maturing technology and continued cost reduction. However, as batteries and power conversion systems remain costly, the power plant profitability depends on the capacity determination of the battery energy storage system (BESS). This study explored an approach for optimal capacity determination of a BESS combined with renewable energy considering the complex degradation of lithium-ion batteries. The proposed sizing algorithm iteratively evaluates the effect of BESS operation on battery degradation and estimates the cash flows of the power plant. In addition, we studied battery augmentation that adds the storage capacity in the base system to sustain the BESS capacity throughout the project planning horizon. Using data from South Korea, we showed that both the optimal storage capacity and project profitability are higher when the BESS is combined with solar generation than when combined with wind generation. Moreover, simulation results demonstrated that the proposed battery augmentation scheme improves the project profitability by deferring the upfront cost of batteries and increasing the total revenue. The proposed approach can provide a comprehensive framework for the parties involved in a BESS project to accurately calculate the BESS sizes and maximize the project profitability.},

  abstract = {In response to the burgeoning threats of climate change to humanity, numerous governments, such as those of the United States and most European countries, have launched rollout programs for the distribution of smart metering technology (SMT). Despite this notable recent investment, questions of whether and why SMT adoption facilitates the reduction of households' energy demands remain relatively unexplored. Building on cognitive dissonance theory, we propose a research model for SMT adoption, residential energy-saving behaviors, and moderating factors. We then empirically test the model using a rich household dataset from the United Kingdom between 2012 and 2016. Our results show that SMT adoption is positively associated with energy-saving behaviors, while energysaving motivations substantially moderate this association---a lower level of concern about saving energy / a higher level of concern about climate change amplifies this effect. Importantly, we find that SMT usage positively moderates this relationship, but this marginal gain decreases in technology usage intensity. Our findings contribute to the information systems literature by showing a consequence of new technology adoption along with the role of cognitive dissonance in promoting intended objectives and identifying potential moderating effects. We discuss actionable insights for policymakers and utility firms.},

However, they should only be relied upon once thoroughly proven. This paper reports the first international validation of reanalysis for wind energy, testing NASA's MERRA and MERRA-2 in 23 European countries. Both reanalyses suffer significant spatial bias, overestimating wind output by 50\% in northwest Europe and underestimating by 30\% in the Mediterranean. We derive national correction factors, and show that after calibration national hourly output can be modelled with R2 above 0.95. Our underlying data are made freely available to aid future research. We then assess Europe's wind resources with twenty-year simulations of the current and potential future fleets. Europe's current average capacity factor is 24.2\%, with countries ranging from 19.5\% (Germany) to 32.4\% (Britain). Capacity factors are rising due to improving technology and locations; for example, Britain's wind fleet is now 23\% more productive than in 2005. Based on the current planning pipeline, we estimate Europe's average capacity factor could increase by nearly a third to 31.3\%. Countries with large stakes in the North Sea will see significant gains, with Britain's average capacity factor rising to 39.4\% and Germany's to 29.1\%.},

Within this point of view, its main preference properties will be characterized and its utility representation provided through local utilities with an explicit dependence on the assessed revenue's distribution (quantile) function. Then, an intuitive interpretation for the related probability dependence and the piecewise form of such utility will be introduced on an investment pricing context, in which a CVaR maximizer agent will behave in a relativistic way based on his previous estimates of the probability function. Finally, such functional will be extended to incorporate a larger range of risk-averse attitudes and its main properties and implications will be illustrated through examples, such as the so-called Allais Paradox.},

  abstract = {Residential buildings account for a large proportion of global energy consumption in both low- and high- income countries. Efficient planning to meet building energy needs while increasing operational, economic, and environmental efficiency requires accurate, high spatial resolution information on energy consumption. Such information is difficult to acquire and most models for estimating residential building energy consumption require detailed knowledge of individual homes and communities which are unlikely to be available at a large scale. To address this need, we introduce a methodology for automatically estimating individual building energy consumption from overhead imagery (e.g. satellite, aerial) and demonstrate the effect of spatial aggregation for further improving accuracy. We use a three-step estimation process by which we (1) automatically segment buildings in overhead imagery using a convolutional neural network and classify them by type (residential or commercial), (2) extract features (e.g. area, perimeter, building density) from those identified residential buildings, and (3) use random forests regression to estimate building energy consumption from those features. The predictive capability of this approach is evaluated in two locations: Gainesville, Florida, and San Diego, California. The building detector correctly identifies 84\% and 88\% of buildings in Gainesville and San Diego, respectively. The type of building is classified successfully 99\% of the time for residential buildings and 74\% of the time for commercial buildings. With residential buildings identified, this approach predicted individual building-level energy consumption with an R2 of 0.28 and 0.38 for Gainesville and San Diego, respectively. Aggregating the energy consumption estimates across small neighborhoods of size 200~{\texttimes}~200~m and 1000~{\texttimes}~1000~m in Gainesville results in an R2 of 0.91 and 0.97, respectively. We also explore the sensitivity of estimates in San Diego and Gainesville to the training data and its size. Our results suggest that using overhead imagery to estimate the size of buildings has a higher predictive power in estimating residential building energy consumption than common alternatives.},

  abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence has experienced a dramatic methodological shift towards large neural networks trained on plentiful data. This shift has been fueled by recent advances in hardware and techniques enabling remarkable levels of computation, resulting in impressive advances in AI across many applications. However, the massive computation required to obtain these exciting results is costly both financially, due to the price of specialized hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and to the environment, as a result of non-renewable energy used to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In a paper published this year at ACL, we brought this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training and tuning neural network models for NLP (Strubell, Ganesh, and McCallum 2019). In this extended abstract, we briefly summarize our findings in NLP, incorporating updated estimates and broader information from recent related publications, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in the machine learning and artificial intelligence community.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen a surge in the need for uncertainty analysis (UA) for building energy assessment. The rigorous determination of uncertainty in model parameters is a vital but often overlooked part of UA. To undertake this, one has to turn one's attention to a thriving area in engineering statistics that focuses on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for short. This paper applies dedicated methods and theories that are emerging in this area of statistics to the field of building energy models, and specifically to the microclimate variables embedded in them. We argue that knowing the uncertainty in these variables is a vital prerequisite for ensuing UA of whole building behaviour. Indeed, significant discrepancies have been observed between the predicted and measured state variables of building microclimates. This paper uses a set of approaches from the growing UQ arsenal, mostly regression-based methods, to develop statistical models that quantify the uncertainties in the following most significant microclimate variables: local temperature, wind speed, wind pressure and solar irradiation. These are the microclimate variables used by building energy models to define boundary conditions that encapsulate the interaction of the building with the surrounding physical environment. Although our analysis is generically applicable to any of the current energy models, we will base our UQ examples on the energy model used in EnergyPlus.}

Various macro-parameters in a NZEB have different impacts on system design and very few studies have investigated such impacts in a NZEB. Therefore, a systematic sensitivity analysis of macro-parameters in a NZEB has been conducted in this study. Differential sensitivity analysis, a local sensitivity analysis method, is performed on a constructed dynamic simulation platform to study the impacts of each macro-parameter on the sizes of key NZEB systems. The systems include heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, renewable energy system and energy storage system. The influence coefficient of each parameter is calculated to quantify its sensitivity impacts. Meanwhile, an exhaustive search approach is proposed to minimize the overall initial investment cost of the renewable energy system and storage system. The study results are valuable to help designers improve NZEB system design through carefully selecting more accurate design parameters especially those identified with heavy sensitivity impacts. The study also provides a method to optimize the initial investment cost of systems in a NZEB.},

  abstract = {Thermal Response Test (TRT) is commonly conducted in geothermal projects to determine the effective ground thermal conductivity. However, the tests are hardly conducted in small or medium projects due to its considerable costs. Moreover, these projects are more likely to be influenced by the environmental conditions (climate and groundwater level) due to the shallow installation depth of the Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHEs). The objective of this investigation is to find an alternative approach for the estimation of the field effective soil thermal conductivity by considering various testing times, field conditions and U-pipe lengths. To reach this objective, a numerical framework is initially validated by the in-situ measurements. Then, it is used to simulate the TRTs conducted in clay, sandy loam and sand during the hottest day(s) of a year in summer and the coldest day(s) of a year in winter with various U-pipe lengths and groundwater levels. The results show that there is a higher effective soil thermal conductivity in winter than in summer while this difference becomes less significant for the U-pipes longer than 30\,m. Among the studied soils, clay has the least effective thermal conductivity. Sandy loam shows a higher effective thermal conductivity than sand especially in the short U-pipes. The effective soil thermal conductivity varies linearly with a newly defined {$\lambda$} ratio (the water level depth divided by the U-pipe length). It also varies with the U-pipe length in a polynomial form (2nd degree). Finally, an analytical approach is proposed to estimate the effective soil thermal conductivity. The approach is validated by 6 in-situ measurements. The capacity of the approach is also evaluated by a regional multi-layered field.},

When predicting the resulting energy consumption it is frequently assumed that heating demand is unchanged from before the switch from gas heating. However, heating patterns usually change, with a net increase in heating demand to achieve the same level of thermal comfort. This paper discusses the change in pattern and uses modelling to determine the resulting increase in energy demand. It shows that the increase can be predicted with information about dwelling heat loss and thermal mass as well as weather and the pre and post switch heating pattern. The increase can be 20\% or more for homes with high heat loss. It proposes that the metric for heating demand increase would be a useful measure of heat pump readiness, and that the parameters required to assess this should be provided on energy performance certificates.},

To have a high system performance, the energy storage system has to be properly controlled while maintaining a comfortable thermal environment for the occupants. However, defining the optimal charging period for a storage system may be difficult since storage systems address issues with conflicting needs between cost saving and thermal comfort. Moreover, with the increase of the use of renewable energies, the complexity increases with the consideration of the renewable energy production. As a result, the decision process should be able to predict both loads and renewable energy production in order to increase the storage system efficiency. This necessity explains the increasing interest during the last decade for predictive control, i.e., control system considering the forecasting. This paper reviews the recent advancements in building predictive control with energy storage system. Special attention is paid to its limitations and abilities.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis plays an important role in building energy analysis. It can be used to identify the key variables affecting building thermal performance from both energy simulation models and observational study. This paper is focused on the application of sensitivity analysis in the field of building performance analysis. First, the typical steps of implementation of sensitivity analysis in building analysis are described. A number of practical issues in applying sensitivity analysis are also discussed, such as the determination of input variations, the choice of building energy programs, how to reduce computational time for energy models. Second, the sensitivity analysis methods used in building performance analysis are reviewed. These methods can be categorized into local and global sensitivity analysis. The global methods can be further divided into four approaches: regression, screening-based, variance-based, and meta-model sensitivity analysis. Recent research has been concentrated on global methods because they can explore the whole input space and most of them allow the self-verification, i.e., how much variance of the model output (building energy consumption) has been explained by the method used in the analysis. Third, we discuss several important topics, which are often overlooked in the domain of building performance analysis. These topics include the application of sensitivity analysis in observational study, how to deal with correlated inputs, the computation of the variations of sensitivity index, and the software issues. Lastly, the practical guidance is given based on the advantages and disadvantaged of different sensitivity analysis methods in assessing building thermal performance. The recommendations for further research in the future are made to provide more robust analysis in assessing building energy performance.},

A case study of retail building is used to demonstrate the proposed methods to infer four unknown input parameters using EnergyPlus program. The results indicate that the different combinations of energy data can provide various levels of accuracy in estimating unknown input variables in model calibration. This suggests that Bayesian computation is suitable for inferring the parameters when there are missing energy data that can be treated as uninformative output data. The proposed method can be also used to find the redundant information on energy data in order to improve computational efficiency in Bayesian calibration.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment has become an active research field because a number of factors influencing energy use in buildings are inherently uncertain. This paper provides a systematic review on the latest research progress of uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment from four perspectives: uncertainty data sources, forward and inverse methods, application of uncertainty analysis, and available software. First, this paper describes the data sources of uncertainty in building performance analysis to provide a firm foundation for specifying variations of uncertainty factors affecting building energy. The next two sections focus on the forward and inverse methods. Forward uncertainty analysis propagates input uncertainty through building energy models to obtain variations of energy use, whereas inverse uncertainty analysis infers unknown input factors through building energy models based on energy data and prior information. For forward analysis, three types of approaches (Monte Carlo, non-sampling, and non-probabilistic) are discussed to provide sufficient choices of uncertainty methods depending on the purpose and specific application of a building project. For inverse analysis, recent research has concentrated more on Bayesian computation because Bayesian inverse methods can make full use of prior information on unknown variables. Fourth, several applications of uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment are discussed, including building stock analysis, HVAC system sizing, variations of sensitivity indicators, and optimization under uncertainty. Moreover, the software for uncertainty analysis is described to provide flexible computational environments for implementing uncertainty methods described in this review. This paper concludes with the trends and recommendations for further research to provide more convenient and robust uncertainty analysis of building energy. Uncertainty analysis has been ready to become the mainstream approach in building energy assessment although a number of issues still need to be addressed.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen is called to be one of the most important energy vectors in future energy systems. Nowadays, its use in the industry sector is prominent, finding multiple applications in fertilizer production or oil refining. In this sense, some industry sectors demand a considerable amount of hydrogen for their processes. In many cases, hydrogen must be purchased externally, which supposes a challenge due to hydrogen transportation is costly and few efficient. In this context, local hydrogen production through mature electrolysis technology may suppose an attractive alternative in industrial parks. This paper focuses on this topic, in particular, a risk-averse electrolyser sizing methodology is developed. The new approach accounts for uncertainties in electricity prices as well as local renewable generation and demand through an original hybrid stochastic-robust model. The developed uncertainty modelling is integrated into a novel four-level optimization framework, whose main result is the optimal electrolyser rated power. To efficiently attain the solution, an original hybridization of the Benders' decomposition and the Column and Constraint Generation Algorithm is proposed. The developed methodology results efficient in an illustrative three-industry park, showing that installing local hydrogen generation may reduce the amount of hydrogen purchased externally (by 38\%) and project costs by 2.5\%. Furthermore, increasing the robustness level leads to increase the project cost by 8\%, while assuming unfavourable realization of uncertainties. Moreover, the developed tool is further validated in larger parks, involving an increasing number of industries, showing that the proposed methodology scales well with the size of the park.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss Economic Model Predictive Control (E-MPC) in the context of buildings with active energy storage. In particular, we propose a strategy for the optimal control of building Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems with chilled water thermal energy storage (TES). Owing to the multiple time scale dynamic behavior of buildings, coupled with the need to account for potentially extended forecasts of disturbances (e.g., weather, energy prices), the implementation of a centralized E-MPC must consider a relatively long prediction horizon. In turn, this results in computational difficulties that impede on real-time implementation. Computational complexity is further increased by the presence of integer decision variables, related to on/off states and operating modes in the HVAC and TES systems. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel hierarchical E-MPC framework based on (i) establishing the optimal operation of the TES by solving a dynamic scheduling problem in the slow time scale, and (ii) using a control scheme with a shorter horizon in the fast time scale, which addresses objectives related to maintaining the indoor air temperature within comfort bounds at all times during the day. A simulation case study concerning the operation of a TES system at the University of Texas Thermal Fa{\c c}ade Laboratory is presented, showing excellent computational and control performance.},

  abstract = {Background: Economic evaluations are increasingly utilized to inform decisions in healthcare; however, decisions remain uncertain when they are not based on adequate evidence. Value of information (VOI) analysis has been proposed as a systematic approach to measure decision uncertainty and assess whether there is sufficient evidence to support new technologies. Scope: The objective of this paper is to review the principles and applications of VOI analysis in healthcare. Relevant databases were systematically searched to identify VOI articles. The findings from the selected articles were summarized and narratively presented. Findings: Various VOI methods have been developed and applied to inform decision-making, optimally designing research studies and setting research priorities. However, the application of this approach in healthcare remains limited due to technical and policy challenges. Conclusion: There is a need to create more awareness about VOI analysis, simplify its current methods, and align them with the needs of decision-making organizations.},

  abstract = {The concept of Net Zero Energy Building (NZEB), as a grid-connected building that generates as much energy as it uses over a given period, has been developing through policies and research agendas during the last decade as a contribution towards the decarbonization of the building sector. However, since the most applicable and widely used renewable energy supply options are non-programmable, the large-scale NZEBs diffusion into the existing power grids can seriously affect their stability having a relapse on operation costs and environmental impacts. In this context, the study aims at performing the design of the energy systems to be used in the case-study through a wide numbers of point of views, including the grid interaction, global warming potential, and different design alternatives such as using fuel cells and renewable energy generation systems and drawing lessons learned to be saved for similar buildings. A novel approach for developing for NZEBs, combining load match and grid interaction indicators with an environmental impact indicator, is proposed. The proposed design approach allows for the quantification of the power grid interaction and environmental impact (in terms of Global Warming Potential) aiming to find trade-offs between the opposing tendencies of building energy performances and the need to limit the embodied carbon within building envelope and systems. The design approach has been used to investigate the performances of a NZEB prototype with the aim to explore the effectiveness of the solution sets used in the current design (only Photovoltaic system) and plan different solutions (batteries and fuel cells system) for the future ones. For the base case, even though the overall PV energy generation (8069\,kWhe) in a year surpasses the electricity consumption (5290\,kWhe), on a yearly base only the 29\% of the PV generation is used on-site. Hence, the assessed indicators show clearly how installing a PV system merely able to cover the energy uses on a yearly net base (or even slightly oversized) will have stress implications on the power grid. On the other hand, the use of batteries at the building scale largely decreases the reliance on power grid when not programmable renewable sources are present. Moreover, if coupled to the right size of the on-site generation systems, the storage system could increases the environmental benefits arising from the renewable energy technologies (the GHG emission reaches its minimum value of 0.92{$\cdot$}103\,kg CO2eq/year, with a reduction of the 50.4\% if compared to the base case) for a storage capacity of 20\,kWh and a PV system nominal power of 4.56\,kW). Fuel cells guarantee a good load match at high energy efficiency, furthermore, a high installed power of fuel cells is not required to obtain high load cover factor values. On the other hand, since the specific CO2eq emission per unit of energy of the fuel cells are high, the CO2eq emissions are always greater than those of the base case if the system is equipped with a fuel cell system. Therefore, future research will have to focus on the eco-design of fuel cells with to reduce environmental impacts of these systems in a life cycle perspective.},

  abstract = {Simulators often require calibration inputs estimated from real-world data, and the estimate can significantly affect simulation output. Particularly when performing simulation optimisation to find an optimal solution, the uncertainty in the inputs significantly affects the quality of the found solution. One remedy is to search for the solution that has the best performance on average over the uncertain range of inputs yielding an optimal compromise solution. We consider the more general setting where a user may choose between either running simulations or querying an external data source, improving the input estimate and enabling the search for a more targeted, less compromised solution. We explicitly examine the trade-off between simulation and real data collection to find the optimal solution of the simulator with the true inputs. Using a value of information procedure, we propose a novel unified simulation optimisation procedure called Bayesian Information Collection and Optimisation that, in each iteration, automatically determines which of the two actions (running simulations or data collection) is more beneficial. We theoretically prove convergence in the infinite budget limit and perform numerical experiments demonstrating that the proposed algorithm is able to automatically determine an appropriate balance between optimisation and data collection.},

The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution.

This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection.

In the US, buildings represent about 70\% of the total electricity demand and demand response has the potential for reducing peaks of electricity by about 20\%. Unlocking this potential requires control systems that operate on distributed systems, ideally data-driven and model-free. For this, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have gained increased interest in the past years. However, research in RL for demand response has been lacking the level of standardization that propelled the enormous progress in RL research in the computer science community. To remedy this, we created CityLearn, an OpenAI Gym Environment which allows researchers to implement, share, replicate, and compare their implementations of RL for demand response. Here, we discuss this environment and The CityLearn Challenge, a RL competition we organized to propel further progress in this field.},

  abstract = {Digital twins are a new paradigm for our time, offering the possibility of interconnected virtual representations of the real world. The concept is very versatile and has been adopted by multiple communities of practice, policymakers, researchers, and innovators. A significant part of the digital twin paradigm is about interconnecting digital objects, many of which have previously not been combined. As a result, members of the newly forming digital twin community are often talking at cross-purposes, based on different starting points, assumptions, and cultural practices. These differences are due to the philosophical world-view adopted within specific communities. In this paper, we explore the philosophical context which underpins the digital twin concept. We offer the building blocks for a philosophical framework for digital twins, consisting of 21 principles that are intended to help facilitate their further development. Specifically, we argue that the philosophy of digital twins is fundamentally holistic and emergentist. We further argue that in order to enable emergent behaviors, digital twins should be designed to reconstruct the behavior of a physical twin by ``dynamically assembling'' multiple digital ``components''. We also argue that digital twins naturally include aspects relating to the philosophy of artificial intelligence, including learning and exploitation of knowledge. We discuss the following four questions (i) What is the distinction between a model and a digital twin? (ii) What previously unseen results can we expect from a digital twin? (iii) How can emergent behaviours be predicted? (iv) How can we assess the existence and uniqueness of digital twin outputs?},

The strategy employs a two-stage adjustable robust formulation to minimize the system operation cost, wherein a parameter is introduced to adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solution against the modeled uncertainty. Then a column and constraint generation algorithm with modified initialization strategy is adopted to solve this optimization model along with mixed-integer linear programming. Further, we evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy by hourly simulating the system operation of a practical project with Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical results show that the robust scheduling with a proper parameter can be superior to the deterministic strategy in all the studied cases. Additionally, the proposed strategy has similar results with the model-based predictive control strategy while the former only needs to be implemented once. Even in the highest load case, the relative deviation between the two strategies is less than 2\%.},

  abstract = {Building controls are becoming more important and complicated due to the dynamic and stochastic energy demand, on-site intermittent energy supply, as well as energy storage, making it difficult for them to be optimized by conventional control techniques. Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an emerging control technique, has attracted growing research interest and demonstrated its potential to enhance building performance while addressing some limitations of other advanced control techniques, such as model predictive control. This study conducted a comprehensive review of existing studies that applied RL for building controls. It provided a detailed breakdown of the existing RL studies that use a specific variation of each major component of the Reinforcement Learning: algorithm, state, action, reward, and environment. We found RL for building controls is still in the research stage with limited applications (11\%) in real buildings. Three significant barriers prevent the adoption of RL controllers in actual building controls: (1) the training process is time consuming and data demanding, (2) the control security and robustness need to be enhanced, and (3) the generalization capabilities of RL controllers need to be improved using approaches such as transfer learning. Future research may focus on developing RL controllers that could be used in real buildings, addressing current RL challenges, such as accelerating training and enhancing control robustness, as well as developing an open-source testbed and dataset for performance benchmarking of RL controllers.},

The optimal configuration and indicators were obtained based on the comprehensive assessment of energy, economics, environment and grid dependence. A hybrid operation strategy following objective function has been developed to improve the overall performance. A real case in Xi'an of Northwest China was chosen to study according to the simulated load demand, three operation strategies were compared, hourly energy management was assessed, and four electrical energy storage schemes were contrasted. Finally, the scheme that uses surplus electricity to electrolyze water for producing hydrogen to supply consumers under hybrid operation strategy is the optimum selection and the annual hydrogen supply is as high as 81,673~kg. Besides, the effects of main device efficiencies, natural gas price and electricity price on system performance were discussed. The results indicated that the power generation efficiency of gas turbine and market factors have the most conspicuous impact on the proposed system. This work may provide theoretical guidance for relevant research and application.},

In this paper, a Functional Data Analysis approach is used to propose a new data-centric bottom-up model of plug loads based on hourly data monitored at a high spatial resolution and by space-use type for a case-study building. The model comprises a set of fundamental Principal Components (PCs) that describe the structure of all data samples in terms of amplitude and phase. Scores (or weightings) for each daily demand profile express the contribution of each PC to the demand. Together the principal components and the scores constitute a structure-based model potentially applicable beyond the building considered. The results show good agreement between samples generated using the model and monitored data for key parameters of interest including the timing of the daily peak demand.},

  abstract = {If greenhouse emission reduction targets are to be met worldwide, not only will there need to be major investment in decarbonisation of the electricity supply network, but there will also need to be a significant reduction in energy demand. The built environment offers opportunities for demand reduction that can help to achieve the necessary targets. For buildings yet to be built there is a real opportunity to design low-energy environments, but the existing building stock will largely still be in existence in 50 years and so retrofit options must also be explored. No matter how efficient a building it is the occupants that drive the energy consumption - whether by requiring comfortable conditions or by using electrical equipment. While in the residential sector owner-occupiers have particular responsibility for consumption, in the non-domestic sector the financial responsibility may not lie with the building occupants and hence it is harder to target demand reduction interventions. In addition, while in a residential building the behaviour of the individual has a direct and significant impact on energy consumption, in a non-domestic building it is the collective behaviour that is important to understand. The impact of the building occupants on internal loads is critical to assessing the energy efficiency of a design or retrofit. Building energy simulation offers a means to assess the potential benefits of different options without requiring costly in-situ tests. In order for the approach to be viable, however, a simulation needs to demonstrably replicate the building performance. This has proved to be difficult not only pre-construction but even for operational demand, in part because individual and collective occupant behaviour is difficult to quantify. Typically, building energy simulation packages require occupant-related internal loads to be input into the simulation via a deterministic schedule consisting of a peak daily demand and a diversity schedule that describes how the demand varies over a 24hr period. The stochastic nature of occupant-related energy demand is well known but as yet there is no accepted methodology for generating stochastic loads for building energy simulation. A new approach is required. The aim of this thesis is to develop a new model for the definition of occupant-related building internal loads for input into building energy simulation. Early studies showed that a model must not only be able to generate good estimates of the key parameters of interest with a measure of the uncertainty, but must also be able to assimilate data, be able to simulate operational change and be straightforward to use. All buildings generate monitored data of some form, even if it is just monitored consumption for purposes of billing. Since the start of the century there has been a rapidly increasing pool of monitored data at increasing time and spatial resolutions for both residential and non-domestic buildings. Increasing monitoring of electricity consumption generates an opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of the nature of occupant-related internal loads. The requirement for a model to be able to assimilate these data make a data-centric model a natural choice. This study focuses on non-domestic buildings and the collective stochastic behaviour of the occupants as evidenced by monitored plug loads and lighting demand. Using monitored data from four sub-metered buildings across the Cambridge University building stock a functional data analysis approach has been used to extract the underlying structure of the data in a way which facilitates generation of new data samples that encompass the observed behaviour without replication. A key assumption in simulation of non-domestic buildings is that the internal loads are in some way related to the activity that takes place in a building zone. This is problematic both because the definition of activity is indeterminate and because building sub-metering strategies rarely align with the specified activities. Deconstruction of the data allows exploration of this fundamental assumption and leads to the conclusion that activity per se is not a good indicator of internal loads. Instead, for plug loads it is the expected variability of the data that is important, whereas for lighting the control strategy of each individual building zone defines the stochasticity of the demand. The model has been developed into a practical online tool for generation of plug loads and lighting demand in the form of annual hourly time histories of internal load that can be input directly into a building energy simulation. As a design tool the modeller can select an expected level of variability in demand and use estimated base load and load range to generate synthetic demand profiles. The beauty of the approach is that if monitored data are available - for example when optimising retrofit designs - the data can be used to generate synthetic time histories that encompass observed demand but can also be modified to account for operational change - a reduction in minimum daily demand for example. Finally this thesis suggests a potential alternative to the activity-based deterministic approach for the specification of occupant-related building internal loads. Rather than generating loads for each new simulation on a case by case basis, the suggestion is to use an approach similar to that used for the specification of weather data - another stochastic input. The proposal is to create annual hourly stochastic samples of typical demand according to the expected variability. These would be used with user-defined energy use intensity values with scenarios for extreme demand in much the same way that typical and future weather scenarios are modelled. The methodology presented here is one such way to generate annual hourly stochastic sample data and provides an initial step towards the specification of such typical load profiles.},

  abstract = {Distributed energy systems have been proved as an effective solution to energy depletion and environmental pollution. However, the decision making on the distributed energy system planning is difficult because multiple evaluative criteria and alternative systems are involved in the evaluation process. The study, therefore, is aimed at proposing a multicriteria comprehensive evaluation framework for the DES plan. First, the evaluation criteria system is established to offer a fundamental premise for the fair evaluation, based on numerous researches on DES evaluation. In the established criteria system, technology, economy, environment, and socio-politics are scrutinized. Second, the subjective weights, objective weights and the comprehensive weights of criteria are determined by the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method, Shannon entropy method and a comprehensive method, respectively. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method combines the triangular fuzzy number and the analytic hierarchy process method. The triangular fuzzy number incorporates the decision-makers' uncertainties during evaluation and thus improves the efficiency of decision making. The comprehensive method combines the single-objective optimization and Jaynes' maximal entropy principle method. Third, the grey relational analysis method is used to achieve the alternatives' ranking with and without preferences. The proposed framework is employed to evaluate various distributed energy systems for a cultural industrial park in Changsha of China. Results show that the system that integrates water source heat pump with the improved Combined Cooling, Heating \& Power (WSHP~+~CCHP) is optimal in the integrated evaluation and the evaluations with technology priority and economy priority, with a grey relational degree of 0.7475, 0.7239, and 0.5764, respectively. The three systems that exploit renewable energy, i.e. the system that integrates ground source heat pump with the improved Combined Cooling, Heating \& Power (GSHP~+~CCHP), the system that integrates water source heat pump with the improved Combined Cooling, Heating \& Power (WSHP~+~CCHP) and the system that ground source heat pump with water source heat pump (GSHP~+~WSHP), have a better ranking than the other two systems in the evaluation with socio-political priority. The case study of the park demonstrates the proposed framework's feasibility of multi-criteria comprehensive evaluation for industrial park-level distributed energy systems. The study hopes to provide some references for the multicriteria evaluation of distributed energy systems.},

  abstract = {Mitigating global climate change requires decarbonizing the electricity sector, but the optimal strategy for doing so is not obvious. As power plants fueled by coal and petroleum are phased out, other generation technologies must fill the gap. While technically feasible, many low-carbon technologies are currently expensive -- though costs may fall with experience. As an alternative, natural gas-fired power plants provide lower-carbon electricity -- and cheaply if gas is abundant. The least-cost portfolio of generation technologies depends on several uncertain parameters. This paper presents a stylized model of the global electricity sector and evaluates several decarbonization strategies focused on three bridge technologies -- natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear -- over the period 2015--2050. With constraints on total demand for electricity and penetration of renewables, I find that the results are sensitive to the learning curve for CCS, the cost of natural gas, and the social cost of carbon. Depending on the true state of the world, decision-makers may find either natural gas power plants or CCS to be least-cost options for decarbonization portfolios. The expected value of information from resolving uncertainty is hundreds of billions of dollars, indicating high social benefits from investments into scientific research.},

  abstract = {In this technical analysis, we studied the effects of complete electrification of space heating in the Texas residential sector on the energy consumption, peak power demand, and grid capacity utilization in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) electricity grid. We utilized the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) ResStock tool to develop geographically representative housing stock models and the physics-based EnergyPlus modeling software to create an aggregate building stock energy model that represents the residential sector in the ERCOT operating region. In this aggregate building energy model, we replace all natural gas and other fossil-fuel furnaces with reversible electric heat pumps of varying efficiencies that can provide heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. We integrate spatially-resolved actual meteorological weather data with the building stock energy model to simulate a specific year (2016) of hourly-resolved energy usage in the ERCOT region. We find the annual electricity consumption, peak hourly power demand for each day, and load duration curves for each of 17 regions within ERCOT. From the base case, the absolute winter peak electrical power demand in the residential sector could increase by as much as 36\%, or 12 GW. These results indicate that grid capacity would need to increase by ~10 GW (a ~25\% increase for the residential sector) to accommodate a winter peaking residential sector. Though winter electricity consumption would increase for home heating, the annual amount of electricity consumption would stay roughly the same or decrease because the higher efficiency heat pumps provide more efficient cooling than the conventional air conditioners they also replace. Using average 2018 emissions rates, we estimate a change to standard efficiency heat pumps would lead to a 4.1\% reduction of CO2 emissions and a 5.8\% reduction of NOx emissions from the residential sector. There is no significant change in SOx emissions in our standard efficiency scenario, but in the high and ultra-high aggregate efficiency scenarios, SOx emissions are reduced by 8.3\% and 15.0\% respectively.},

  abstract = {Traditional sample size calculations for randomized clinical trials depend on somewhat arbitrarily chosen factors, such as type I and II errors. Type I error, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference when it is true, is most often set to 0.05, regardless of the cost of such an error. In addition, the traditional use of 0.2 for the type II error means that the money and effort spent on the trial will be wasted 20 per cent of the time, even when the true treatment difference is equal to the smallest clinically important one and, again, will not reflect the cost of making such an error. An effectiveness trial (otherwise known as a pragmatic trial or management trial) is essentially an effort to inform decision-making, i.e. should treatment be adopted over standard? As such, a decision theoretic approach will lead to an optimal sample size determination. Using incremental net benefit and the theory of the expected value of information, and taking a societal perspective, it is shown how to determine the sample size that maximizes the difference between the cost of doing the trial and the value of the information gained from the results. The methods are illustrated using examples from oncology and obstetrics. Copyright {\copyright} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The duality theory of programming under uncertainty is developed for the special case of proportional penalties and normal probability distributions, and from this an approximately optimal sampling plan is determined by the solution to a separable nonlinear programming problem with linear constraints. The duality theory is interesting per se; in particular, it evidences clearly the specific roles of the means and standard deviations in determining the solution. The duality theory of programming under uncertainty has been available for some time, at least in principle, by application of the general theory. It is worthwhile, however, to examine specially structured problems in finer detail, and that is the purpose of this paper.}

  abstract = {Smart charging strategies for electric vehicles (EVs) require as input information such as energy requirement and dwell time. In practice, that information is often not available. However, estimations may be obtained from historical charging behavior. This paper investigates the added value of historical information for EV charging strategies based on real-world EV charging data collected in an office building parking lot with 125 chargers. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights into EV charging behavior at office building parking lots, based on a statistical analysis of the data. The added value of data availability in EV charging strategies for day-ahead planning and real-time operation of office building parking lots is assessed via a set of quality metrics that measure user satisfaction and impact on the local grid. Offline charging strategies under various degrees of available information are validated by comparing their performance with the real-time operation of the parking lot. Results show a power peak reduction of more than 50\% using historical data and simple estimations of arrival times, dwell times, and energy requirement. A trade-off between power peaks and service quality (on average 4.4kWh energy not served) is observed. It was found that knowledge of individual average energy provides higher added value compared to knowing individual average dwell time in both offline planning and real-time operation of the parking lot.},

Building performance simulation (BPS) tools usually adopt typical meteorological year (TMY) as the outdoor climate input. Despite that many scholars and institutes have developed TMY datasets, these datasets are usually based on distinct data sources and methods. Considering the increase of international cooperation construction projects, compatible TMY dataset for different countries is in urgent need. This paper presents a global typical meteorological year (TMY) database covering 38,947 stations worldwide based on the fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis product released by the European Center (ERA5). The data is created with Chinese Standard Weather Database (CSWD) method to reflect the average level of historical weather. The dataset is saved in a 55 GB database of compressed CSV files and a website is established where users can download their required TMY data for certain cities according to the longitude and latitude information. A systematic validation is conducted to confirm the feasibility of ERA5 as data source and validity of generated TMY data. This TMY-ERA5 dataset is fundamental and essential in building system designs of international construction projects, building performance simulation, especially for some countries lacking ground meteorological stations or missing meteorological year data in the building sector. It can be used as references for other meteorological climate studies.},

Good energy data are the cornerstone to understanding building energy performance and supporting research, design, operation, and policy making for low energy buildings. This paper presents initial outcomes from a joint research project under the U.S.--China Clean Energy Research Center for Building Energy Efficiency. The goal is to decode the driving forces behind the discrepancy of building energy use between the two countries; identify gaps and deficiencies of current building energy monitoring, data collection, and analysis; and create knowledge and tools to collect and analyze good building energy data to provide valuable and actionable information for key stakeholders. This paper first reviews and compares several popular existing building energy monitoring systems in both countries. Next a standard energy data model is presented. A detailed, measured building energy data comparison was conducted for a few office buildings in both countries. Finally issues of data collection, quality, sharing, and analysis methods are discussed. It was found that buildings in both countries performed very differently, had potential for deep energy retrofit, but that different efficiency measures should apply.},

One of the most important challenges in DSM is dealing with uncertainty. Robust optimization methods are widely known as an approach to deal with uncertainty. However, this method tends to be conservative in its solution because it considers worst-case scenarios. In this study, we develop a robust approach of model predictive control (MPC) to reduce conservativeness and maintain robustness in DSM of smart apartment building (SAB). Consisting of two stages is the robust optimization strategy employed in this study. The first stage involves day-ahead scheduling, where four different optimization approaches are implemented. In the second stage, intra-day scheduling is implemented on the basis of day-ahead operational plan. The application of this technique achieves reduced conservativeness and maintains robustness. The simulation results show that by using the proposed approach, compared to conventional robust optimization, while maintaining robustness, the operation cost of day-ahead scheduling can be reduced by 10.79\% and the operation cost of intra-day scheduling can be reduced by 15\%.},

The model is built in consideration of discreteness of equipment capacities, equipment partial load operation and output bounds as well as the influence of ambient temperature on gas turbine performance. The objective function is the total annual cost for investing, maintaining, and operating the system.

The microgrid can integrate different energy sources and increase renewable penetration by balancing the local supplies and demands flexibly. The introduction of the carbon pricing mechanism further impels the energy transition from fossil-fuel generation to renewable generation. However, the uncertainty of renewable outputs and carbon pricing challenges microgrid planning. In this paper, we propose a stochastic optimization model for planning microgrids in industrial parks. It includes three parts: the retirement of existing fossil fuel generators, the deployment of renewable generators, and the installation of energy storage systems. Typical scenarios are generated and reduced to simulate the fluctuations of renewable outputs and carbon price. An adaptive genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the proposed planning model. The case study result verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model and indicates that the proposed model can provide reasonable microgrid planning strategies.},

However, there is a concern that the uncertainties inherent in the model structures and input parameters are at best underplayed and at worst ignored. Compared to other types of energy models, ESOMs tend to use scenarios to handle uncertainties or treat them as a marginal issue. Without adequately addressing uncertainties, the model insights may be limited, lack robustness, and may mislead decision makers. This paper provides an in-depth review of systematic techniques that address uncertainties for ESOMs. We have identified four prevailing uncertainty approaches that have been applied to ESOM type models: Monte Carlo analysis, stochastic programming, robust optimization, and modelling to generate alternatives. For each method, we review the principles, techniques, and how they are utilized to improve the robustness of the model results to provide extra policy insights. In the end, we provide a critical appraisal on the use of these methods.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of Transformer-based solutions for the long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) task. Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss.  To validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future.},

However, after over 20 years of research, it is yet to be adopted by the industry. The difficulty of obtaining a sufficient control-oriented model is one major factor that hinders the application. In particular, what data is required to build the model and what control performance can be expected with a certain model remain unclear. This study attempts to uncover the underlying reasons and guide future research to tackle the challenges. It starts by clarifying a finer categorization of past studies with respect to both modeling methods and modeling purposes. An extended Level of Detail (LoD) framework is proposed to quantify the data usage in each study. Accordingly, meta-analyses are conducted to compare the data requirements of different modeling categories. The criteria and approaches for model performance evaluation are summarized and classified into validation and verification methods, followed by a discussion about the relationship between the model and control performance. The critical review provides new perspectives on the data requirements and performance evaluation of control-oriented models. Ultimately, the paper concludes with five directions for future research to bridge the gaps between data requirements, model performance, and control performance.},

The challenge lies in evaluating the sufficiency of the model and the data usage beforehand. This paper bridges the knowledge gaps in the interactions between data requirements, model quality, and control performance by integrating real-world measurements and simulation-based experiments. The data usage related to occupancy and Internal heat gain (IHG) was studied considering its importance and the absence of consensus in the literature. Varying occupant-related data sources were tested as RC model inputs, including none, schedule, electricity consumption, CO2 ppm, and ideal measurement. Combinations of model inputs and complexities were examined for prediction and control in an office, a classroom, and multi-zone offices on one floor. The results indicated that the usefulness of data is jointly affected by three factors: measurement suitability, model complexity, and modeling purpose. Given the adequate model structure, satisfying prediction and control performance was achieved in offices with no detailed measurement. Meanwhile, electricity and CO2 were needed together to capture the IHG influence and realize the good performance for classrooms. The experiments also uncovered the heterogeneous requirements on models from traditional prediction tests and the control tasks. Lower prediction error did not always mean better control. More importantly, we provided the first quantitative demonstration of the complementary relationship between model adequacy and data informativeness with respect to different purposes. This study advocates the pioneering idea of sparse data usage and parsimonious modeling, which promotes the actual application of MPC in buildings by guiding control-oriented model development.},

In the traditional paradigm of "model-centric" MPC, most effort is devoted to constructing the control-oriented model given specific building properties and data availability. Due to the significant heterogeneity among buildings, the results are hardly reproducible, and a high level of customization is required for each new building. To address this issue, we propose a new "data-centric" approach for MPC, which starts with control-oriented data curation that acquires the necessary and cost-effective data concerning the intended control purpose and the building characteristics. The foundation of data-centric MPC is a standardized framework to quantify the data requirements and the established relationships between data usage and control performance. Such an end-to-end framework promotes actual MPC applications with controllable costs and reliable outcomes. We use tropical office buildings as an example to consolidate the data-centric MPC framework. Two use cases are provided to demonstrate its benefits. Over 10\% of energy saving was achieved without excessive occupant-related data, and occupant-centric control significantly improved the thermal comfort only with proper data acquisition.},

  abstract = {The integration of renewable energy, such as solar photovoltaics (PV), is critical to reducing carbon emissions but has exerted pressure on power grid operations. Microgrids with buildings, distributed energy resources, and energy storage systems are introduced to alleviate these issues, where optimal operation is necessary to coordinate different components on the grid. Model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) have been proven capable of solving such operation problems in proof-of-concept studies. However, their applications in real-world buildings are limited by the low reproducibility and the high implementation costs. There is a lack of systematic and quantitative understanding of their strength and weakness in actual applications. Hence, this study aims to improve the scalability of optimal control solutions for smart grid operations by comparing MPC and RL regarding their requirements and control performance. We leveraged the CityLearn simulation framework to implement and compare alternative control solutions based on MPC and RL for the energy management of microgrids. In addition to the control performance of cost saving and carbon reduction, other factors such as robustness and transferability were also examined. While both methods achieved promising results, MPC had slightly better performance and could be transferred more smoothly. Given the standardized framework, MPC is more suitable in most cases for the purpose of microgrid operations. However, RL could be preferable for its quickness in making decisions if a large number of energy systems are involved.},

  abstract = {Imbalance costs caused by forecasting errors are considerable for grid-connected wind farms. In order to reduce such costs, two onsite storage technologies, i.e., power-to-hydrogen-to-power and lithium battery, are investigated considering 14 uncertain technological and economic parameters. Probability density distributions of wind forecasting errors and power level are first considered to quantify the imbalance and excess wind power. Then, robust optimal sizing of the onsite storage is performed under uncertainty to maximize wind-farm profit (the net present value). Global sensitivity analysis is further carried out for parameters prioritization to highlight the key influential parameters. The results show that the profit of power-to-hydrogen-to-power case is sensitive to the hydrogen price, wind forecasting accuracy and hydrogen storage price. When hydrogen price ranges in (2, 6) {\texteuro}/kg, installing only electrolyzer can earn profits over 100 k{\texteuro}/MWWP in 9\% scenarios with capacity below 250 kW/MWWP, under high hydrogen price (over 4 {\texteuro}/kg); while installing only fuel cell can achieve such high profits only in 1.3\% scenarios with capacity below 180 kW/MWWP. Installing both electrolyzer and fuel cell (only suggested in 22\% scenarios) results in profits below 160 k{\texteuro}/MWWP, and particularly 20\% scenarios allow for a profit below 50 k{\texteuro}/MWWP due to the contradictory effects of wind forecasting error, hydrogen and electricity price. For lithium battery, investment cost is the single highly influential factor, which should be reduced to 760 {\texteuro}/kWh. The battery capacity is limited to 88\,kW h/MWWP. For profits over 100 k{\texteuro}/MWWP (in 3\% scenarios), the battery should be with an investment cost below 510 {\texteuro}/kWh and a depth of discharge over 63\%. The power-to-hydrogen-to-power case is more advantageous in terms of profitability, reliability and utilization factor (full-load operating hours), while lithium battery is more helpful to reduce the lost wind and has less environmental impact considering current hydrogen market.},

However, the building energy management system (BEMS) is now facing more challenges and uncertainties with the increasing penetration of renewables and complicated interactions between humans and buildings. Classical model predictive control (MPC) has shown its capacity to reduce building energy consumption, but it suffers from labor-intensive modelling and complex on-line control optimization. Recently, with the growing accessibility to the building control and automation data, data-driven solutions have attracted more research interest.

Firstly, we review the applications of building load prediction model (task T). Then, we review the modeling algorithms that improve machine learning performance and accuracy (performance P). Throughout the papers, we also review the literature from the data perspective for modeling (experience E), including data engineering from the sensor level to data level, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of well-studied and relatively unexplored fields for future research reference. We also identify the gaps in current machine learning application and predict for future trends and development.},

  abstract = {To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the world economy needs to be significantly decarbonized. Among all sectors, the decarbonization of heat is likely to incorporate a significant electronification using electric heat pumps, placing additional strain on electric grid infrastructure in countries like the UK. In this paper, we present an assessment of the impacts of heat electrification on the grid in the UK in 2050 when the net zero is reached. A high-resolution heat demand forecasting model is developed to estimate hourly heat demand at the national level and it is validated using published historical data. The validated model is then used to predict the hourly heat demand of the UK in 2050. The impact of heat electrification is then analysed based on several different scenarios. The results show that heat decarbonization through electrification will have a significant impact on the grid. In the case of extreme global warming, both hourly peak demand and annual total heat demand will drop by about 45\% in 2050, compared with published data in 2010. In the case of 100\% electrification with no global warming, the total annual electricity demand for heating is 109.4~TWh. The hourly peak demand of electricity will increase from 96.6~GW to 146.7~GW, which requires an increase of electricity generation capacity by around 50\%. It is however economically infeasible and unviable to build such a huge new generation capacity that would only be used in winter when the peak heat demand peaks but will be switched off during summer. Hence, mitigation measures such as heat storage will play a vital role in balancing power generation and consumption, as well as reducing the required new generation capacity.},

However, very few existing studies focus on predicting one-hour ahead or longer freeway speed. In this study, a novel architecture called Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) is adopted to predict freeway speed with the prediction horizons from 5~min to 150~min. The TFT can capture short-term and long-term temporal dependence by a multi-head attention mechanism. Moreover, the TFT utilizes the fusion decoder to import various types of inputs which can improve the prediction accuracy. To demonstrate the advantage of the TFT, traffic speed data collected from an interstate freeway in Minnesota are used to train and test the prediction model. The TFT prediction performance is compared with several classic traffic prediction methods, and the results reveal that the TFT performs best in speed prediction when the prediction horizon is longer than 30~min.},

It can benefit learning-based controllers, e.g., Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning. However, obtaining reliable models is non-trivial, especially when only limited historical data generated by the baseline controller is available. This paper analyses the modelling tasks and identifies the sources of prediction error to obtain suitable machine learning models, and then proposes a training framework to provide a well-designed training procedure, mitigating the reducible errors. Six typical machine learning methods are evaluated using simulated and real-world datasets using in- and out-of-distribution data. Comprehensive evaluation metrics are also proposed. The results of absolute error and prediction interval coverage percentage indicate that purely point estimation is not enough to provide reliable predictions, and uncertainties must be quantified. Further results from analysis of the out-of-distribution data show that although some models have satisfactory predictions on in-distribution data, their capability of interpolation and extrapolation is poor. Some predictions may deviate from the targets. Point estimation may provide over-confident results. It is, therefore, essential to quantify the uncertainty caused by the lack of data to ensure that the true value falls into the prediction interval with high probability. The decomposition of the total uncertainty provides more information and detects out-of-distribution data. These investigations demonstrated the importance of accurate point estimation and uncertainty quantification for models' reliability.},

The presence of energy hubs, natural gas grids and dispersed generation resources at the distribution network's moderate- and low-voltage levels is the first challenge facing the energy distribution network operator. When PHEV vehicles are included in the energy hub, batteries can act as a general storage system and increase the possible integration of RES within power system networks. For the optimal operation of an energy hub that involves RES, PHEV, electrolyzer, fuel cell vehicles, boiler, hydrogen tank, rectifier, a heat storage system and inverter, a new model has been proposed in this paper. A new model has been developed for estimating consumption-related uncertainty of PHEVs during trips using information gap decision-making theory IGDT under risk aversion and risk-taking strategies. Additionally, a model for the uncertainty of RES is put out based on scenario development and reduction. A unique solution based on routing is presented since tackling the problem mentioned above might be error-prone mathematically. In this model, the possibility of entrapment in local optimum is reduced by increasing local and global searches. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on a sample system and in different scenarios. Consequently, the proposed method maximizes target operation under risk-free and risk-averse strategies while minimizing target performance under risk-taking strategies.},

Different algorithms often give inconsistent or sometimes conflicting interpretations of the same data. This lack of consensus has adverse implications and can be mitigated via ensemble modeling, an algorithmic paradigm that combines many competing models rather than choosing only a single ``best'' model. Here we report one such time-series decomposition algorithm for deriving nonlinear ecosystem dynamics across multiple timescales---A Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). As an ensemble algorithm, BEAST quantifies the relative usefulness of individual decomposition models, leveraging all the models via Bayesian model averaging. We tested it upon simulated, Landsat, and MODIS data. BEAST detected changepoints, seasonality, and trends in the data reliably; it derived realistic nonlinear trends and credible uncertainty measures (e.g., occurrence probability of changepoints over time)---some information difficult to derive by conventional single-best-model algorithms but critical for interpretation of ecosystem dynamics and detection of low-magnitude disturbances. The combination of many models enabled BEAST to alleviate model misspecification, address algorithmic uncertainty, and reduce overfitting. BEAST is generically applicable to time-series data of all kinds. It offers a new analytical option for robust changepoint detection and nonlinear trend analysis and will help exploit environmental time-series data for probing patterns and drivers of ecosystem dynamics.},

This paper proposes an optimal economic energy dispatch model of the CCHP system incorporating deep learning of load predictions to fulfill active control strategy in dynamic programming. A cross linear optimization method with a half update strategy of component efficiencies is developed to solve and calculate the variable component efficiencies in the CCHP system. Compared to the genetic algorithm, the proposed method achieves better results and the convergence time is reduced by 93\%. The model predictive control of the CCHP system in load predictions of an artificial neural network is combined to the dynamic programming to realize the active energy dispatch strategy. The effects of short-term prediction and long-term prediction on forecast performances and operation costs are discussed. The case study demonstrates that the ideal prediction horizon of 8~h is recommended to fully realize the active functions of energy storage devices in the CCHP system. The proposed active strategy with model predictive control reduces the operational cost by 3.66\% compared to the passive control strategy.},

  abstract = {It has become crucial to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of building loads (peak cooling load, peak heating load, annual cooling demand and annual heating demand) for meeting the risk assessment of building energy planning. Therefore, a new Monte Carlo (MC) method based on building performance simulation (BPS) is proposed to solve the problem of building loads forecasting at planning phase. Furthermore, the sensitivity of building loads is examined using two global sensitivity analysis (GSA) methods, including meta modeling method based on tree Gaussian process (TGP) and regression method based on standard regression coefficient (SRC). Finally, a case study of office building is conducted. The results show that the MC method constructed by the combination of R language platform and EnergyPlus software can generate models rapidly and simulate accurately building loads. Note that it is necessary to assess the stability of results as a function of sample size from uncertainty analysis in applying the MC method into building loads assessment. The TGP-based GSA method is applicable to identify and analyze key variables affecting building loads. It is recommended that at least two inherently different GSA methods should be applied to provide robust sensitivity results. Moreover, this study also provides insight on building energy planning and energy conservation design according to the results of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for case study.},

  abstract = {Building energy consumption has increased rapidly in the past decade, in particular for heat demand and electric vehicles, owning to the development of economy and improvement of living standard. Distributed Energy Systems (DESs), which can effectively improve the share of renewable energy in the energy mix, lower the energy cost and reduce environmental impact, is a promising approach to meet the increased energy demand. This paper presents a review of the system architecture of DESs for building decarbonization, including hybrid energy systems, energy storage technologies, building flexible loads, and electric vehicles. The uncertainties from both the environment and human interventions challenge the energy management due to the asynchrony between energy generation and energy consumption.

  abstract = {To reach net zero emissions by 2050, the UK government relies heavily on heat degasification in buildings by using heat pump technology. However, existing buildings may have terminal radiators that require a higher operating temperature than what heat pumps typically provide. Increasing the size of radiators and thermally insulating building envelopes could be a potential solution, but the feasibility of these practices is uncertain due to space constraints and high retrofit costs. This study investigates the feasibility and potential benefits of incorporating air-source heat pumps into existing gas boiler heating systems to meet heating demands. The proposed probabilistic optimal air-source heat pump design method enhances energy flexibility and climate adaptability, taking into account a wide range of uncertainty sources and multiple flexibility services (e.g., energy and ancillary services). Heating systems of three educational buildings at the University of Cambridge are used as a testbed to assess and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, under future climate scenarios and projected decreases in heating demand due to climate change. Results indicate that the best retrofit alternative of the hybrid heating system reduces carbon emissions by 88\%, total costs by 54\% over its lifespan, and has an average payback period of around 3~years. Air-source heat pumps can meet the majority of the heating demand (around 80\%) with gas boilers used for ``top-up'' heating during high demand. Furthermore, air-source heat pumps' design capacity can fulfil future cooling demand even if retrofit optimization is initially focused on meeting heating needs.},
